<h2 class="nobreak">TRANSLATOR&#8217;S NOTE</h2></div>


<p>The two parts forming this story are
published separately in Denmark; and
Part I, which I have called <i>Cordt</i>, was
first issued anonymously as <i>The Old
Room</i>, with a preface intended to convey
the idea that the work had been written
by the heroine of the story. When Part
II appeared, under the title of <i>Cordt&#8217;s
Son</i>, in which Fru Adelheid has returned
to the old house and the old room, Carl
Ewald suppressed this preface. It is so
beautiful that it were unfair to deprive
the author&#8217;s American readers of the joy
of it. The German translator prints it
at the end of his version, by way of an
appendix; I prefer to give it here:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">PREFACE<br />
TO THE FIRST (ANONYMOUS) DANISH<br />
EDITION</p>

<p>I who write this book am still young and
fair to look upon and rich and very sad.</p>

<p>My youth and my beauty fill me with
horror and I know not what to do with
the wealth which I possess. Daily my
sorrow sings the same song in my ears. It
rustles in the folds of my train; it sighs in
the fragrant flowers at my breast. Through
the long nights I sit on the edge of my bed
thrusting away the dream that comes with
glaring eyes.</p>

<p>Now what I have written is a lie.</p>

<p>When I wrote it, it was the truth: now,
it is a lie. When I saw it set down on
paper, I knew that my youth was my
strength and my right; that, if I were
ugly, I could not live; and that, if I were
poor, I should die.</p>

<p>And now I am glad; and there is nothing
on earth but my gladness.</p>

<p>I am in this case.</p>

<p>But I let the words stand as I wrote
them, for I know that the time will come&mdash;and
that soon&mdash;when all of them will be
true again ... until they once more become
a lie.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>And so my book will grow, through
still and stormy times, until the day comes
when I am again what I now am.</p>

<p>But that, too, is itself a lie. For I was
always the same.</p>

<p>But there came a moment at which
HE saw me as I am; and there my book
will end. For after that there was but
little that differed from the stories in
other books and less still that I remember.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it is true that the
world contains a room in which the
radiant light of happiness flamed up before
my eyes. And the light went out and
the door closed upon me.</p>

<p>And, if any one, from what I have here
written, comes to think me a great and
abject sinner, then he is indeed right.
But, if he thinks that I have been cast
off by the world, then he is at fault.</p>

<p>For I go with head erect and peacefully
along the road that others go; and I am
welcome among the best. The lights in
the high hall stream down upon my hair;
the men honour me with their desire, the
women with their ill-will.</p>

<p>There lives only one who knows my
guilt and he has condemned me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>For it was HE that stayed in the room
where the light burns. And she that
went out into the street was I.</p></blockquote>

<p>I am indebted to the collaboration of
my friend Mr. Osman Edwards&mdash;one of
the foremost linguists in Europe&mdash;for his
translation of the six songs, in which he
has carefully preserved both the sense
and the exquisite rhythm, and also for
many suggestions regarding the accurate
solution of such difficulties as occurred
in the prose text.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE room looks out upon the square,
which is so big and so fashionable
that there is no business done in it.</p>

<p>By day there is a sound of carriages,
but at a distance; for the house that contains
the room is thrust a long way back
and its walls are as thick as the walls of
a castle. In the evening, the square
shines with a thousand lights; at night,
you can hear the rippling of the fountain,
which never begins and never stops, cries,
no one knowing what they are, and
solitary steps that approach and retreat
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>The room is built high over the square.
Its window is a door and leads to a balcony
filled with red flowers. When the
wind lashes them, their petals fly right
over into the basin of the fountain and
rock upon the water.</p>

<p>The room is long and deep.</p>

<p>Where the window is, the light streams
in through the wide, stained-glass panes;
but, inside, where the fireplace rises to
the ceiling, it is always dark.</p>

<p>No one has ever seen the curtain drawn
before the window. But, even if the sun
could shine right into the room, it would
never have seen a human being there.
By day, the room is dead.</p>

<p>It is placed so strangely in the house
that it seems to form no part of it. The
life of every day passes outside it; and,
even when the whole house is lighted up
and the horses paw the ground in the gateway
and glasses clink and music sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in the great drawing-room, the door of the
room remains constantly closed.</p>

<p>No one has ever crossed its threshold
but the master of the house and his wife
and the oldest servant in their employ.</p>

<p>For the room is the soul of the house
and its tradition and its secret chamber.</p>

<p>It was destined for this purpose long
ago by the man who built the house; and
so cunningly did he contrive it that no
one could guess that it was there, unless
he knew of it. Then, when the work
was ended, he sealed the architect&#8217;s tongue
with a solemn oath and a heavy fee and
the man kept his sworn word.</p>

<p>And the builder of the house decorated
the room as richly as was possible according
to the means of those days, with
gilt and figured leather hangings and
stained-glass window-panes and costly
carpets from the East. But he placed
no furniture in it until the very last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Then he brought two splendid armchairs
which he had had made for him
in Milan.</p>

<p>They were odd-looking chairs. They
glided so smoothly over the floor that a
child could move them, and were so large
that people became quite small when they
sat in them. Their woodwork was carved
into birds and animals, whose faces
grinned strangely in the dark but ceased
to do so when the lights were lit.</p>

<p>When everything was thus ordered for
the best, he called an old servant, who
had been in the house since he was a
child, gave him a key of the room and
told him to care for it faithfully. Every
evening, when it grew dusk, he was to
light the candles on the mantelpiece and
he was to do this even if he knew
that his master was travelling in distant
lands. Every morning, he was to
adjust the room with his own hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
None but himself was ever to cross the
threshold.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day when he
took possession of his house, the master,
having first shown her all its other beauties,
brought his wife to the room.</p>

<p>She looked round in wonder. But he
made her sit in one of the great chairs,
seated himself in the other and spoke to
her in these words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sweetheart, this room is for you and
me and for none other in the world. I
have placed it in the most secluded part
of the house, far from the counting-house,
where we work, from the passages, along
which our servants go, and from the
drawing-room, where we receive our
guests, ay, even from our marriage-bed,
where you will sleep by my side.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took his hand and kissed it and
looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be the temple of our marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
hallowed by our love, which is greater
than anything that we know. Here we
will pray to Him Who gave us to each
other. Here we will talk gladly and
earnestly every evening when our hearts
impel us to. And, when we come to die,
our son shall bring his wife here and they
shall do as we did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon he wrote down in a document
how all this had happened and they
both sealed it with their names. He hid
the document in a secret recess in the
wall. And, when all this was accomplished,
they fell upon their knees and,
folding their hands together, offered a simple
prayer to God before they went to rest.</p>

<p>These two are long since dead. But
their son complied with their will and his
son after him and so on and so forth until
the present day.</p>

<p>And, however riches might increase or
diminish with the varying fortunes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
times, the old house in the square continued
in the possession of the family. For
he who was its head always lived in such
a way that he kept his ancestral home.</p>

<p>The room stood untouched, as was appointed,
and the document grew old and
yellow in the secret recess in the wall.
Once only in the time of each master
of the house was it taken out; and that
was on the evening when he first brought
his young wife to the secret chamber.
Then they wrote their names upon it
and put it away again.</p>

<p>But it became the custom for each of
them that took lawful possession of the
room to adorn it with a piece of furniture
after his own taste and heart. And they
were strange objects that, in the course
of time, gathered round the two great,
strange chairs.</p>

<p>There was one of the owners of the
house who was kindly and cheerful to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
end. He placed in the room, in his wife&#8217;s
honor, a costly spinning-wheel, richly inlaid,
which whirred merrily every evening
for many a good year and which stood as
it was, with thread upon the spindle.</p>

<p>There was one whose thoughts were always
roaming and never at rest and whose
intellect was obscured before he died. He
presented the room with an ingenious representation
of the heavenly system. When
a spring was pressed, the spheres lit up
and ran their eternal courses; and he sat
and played with the stars to his last day.</p>

<p>There was another whose wife dreaded
the deep silence of the room and never
entered it but once. He waited for five
years and then had a doll made, a woman,
life-size and beautifully dressed. He put
it on a chair in the window, so that the
light fell on its vacant face. But his son,
who loved his mother, drew the doll back,
so that it was hidden in the curtain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>There was one whose wife was in the
habit of singing when she was sad, as she
often was. She brought a spinet, with
slender, beautiful notes, which sang like
a mother singing her child to sleep. In
time, its sound grew very thin. When
it was played upon in the room at night,
it sounded over the silent square like a
humming in the air; and none that passed
knew what it was.</p>

<p>There was also one who had his wife&#8217;s
portrait painted and hung the picture on
the wall. He broke his wedding-vows
and his grandson took the picture down.
But, where it had been, a light stain remained
that could not be removed.</p>

<p>The man who was master of the house
at the time when that happened which is
related in this book had brought nothing
as yet. But his wife had set up a thing
that had caught her eye more than all
that she had seen in the way of art on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
long travels. This was a jar of a preposterous
shape, large and bright and of
a pale tint. On one side was the figure
of a naked man writhing through thorns.
It stood on a stone pedestal hewn from
a rock near Jerusalem.</p>

<p>That was how the room was.</p>

<p>Each evening, when it grew dark, the
oldest servant in the house lit the candles
on the mantelpiece. Each morning, before
any one was awake, he cleaned the
room with his own hands and watered
the red flowers on the balcony. When
winter came, he strewed bread-crumbs
for the sparrows that gathered on the
baluster and twittered.</p>

<p>But the name of him that owned the
house was Cordt. And his wife was Fru
Adelheid.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Cordt</span> sat in one of the armchairs by
the chimney, reading.</p>

<p>He was in evening clothes and held his
crush-hat and his gloves on his knees.
He turned the pages quickly. Every moment,
he swept his thick hair from his forehead;
every moment, he looked at Fru
Adelheid, who was walking up and down
the floor with her hands behind her back.</p>

<p>She was very tall and slender. Her face
was as white as her white gown. Her
mouth was very red, her eyes looked large
and strange. She wore flowers in her hair
and at her waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not reading, Cordt,&#8221; she said;
but she passed with her back to him.</p>

<p>He closed the book and laid it aside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Then he moved the chair so as to turn his
face towards her. His eyes were larger
than hers and steadier, his mouth firmer.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful you are!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She laughed softly and took his hand
and kissed it:</p>

<p>&#8220;How charming of you!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She began to walk again. He stretched
out his legs and lay with his head back in
the chair, but followed her all the time
with his eyes. Now and again, she stopped,
smoothed her gown, let her fingers stray
over the keys of the spinet and then went
out on the balcony through the open door.
He could not see her from where he was
sitting, but the white train of her dress lay
inside the room and he looked at that.</p>

<p>Then she returned, sat on the arm of
the other chair and swung her foot to and
fro.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not like you to be in good spirits,
Adelheid,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Her eyes shone. She looked at the fireplace,
where a log lay glowing:</p>

<p>&#8220;You should drink a glass of wine,
Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not care for wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more do I. But I like its exhilaration.
It makes one so light-hearted.
Then everything becomes so charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been drinking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Cordt ... what makes you ask
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you are so light-hearted and
I so charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went up to him and laid her cheek
against his hair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t spoil it for me,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You can, with a single word, and that
would be a great, great sin. You say I
am pretty; and I am glad because you
think so and because I am going out with
you and because you are handsome and
belong to me. We shall be far from each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
other and close together for all that. We
shall nod to each other, as we always do,
and know what we know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He released himself from her gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down a little,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and talk
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed him and sat down in the
chair and then and there forgot her despondency.
Her eyes shone as before.
He raked out the embers and threw a log
upon them. They sat and watched it
catch fire and saw the smoke surround it
and rise up. Her foot tapped the carpet;
he shaded his eyes with his hand and
pursued his thoughts:</p>

<p>&#8220;In my first year at the university,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;there were five of us who were
chums and we used to meet every Saturday
evening. It was generally at my
rooms, for I could best afford it. We
used to sit and drink wine until bright daylight
and then take one another home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8220;You must have drunk a great deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps we did. We
talked so loud and deep. The wine made
us feel bigger, braver and cleverer. Next
day, we were quite different, more reserved
and cool. But we could look one
another boldly in the face, for we had
nothing to repent of. It did not matter
if we had allowed ourselves to be carried
away. We knew one another so well and
trusted one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat and looked at him as he spoke,
but said nothing. Lost in thought, he continued
to throw logs on the fire until she
took one out of his hand and put it aside:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll set the house on fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One should never drink wine with
strangers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You see, it is so
degrading to be stripped bare. And that
is just what happens.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&#8220;You say that as if it meant getting
drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paid no attention to her words, but
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;One unbuttons one&#8217;s self, one reveals
one&#8217;s self. Look at your eyes and your
smile. I have felt it in my own eyes:
hundreds of times, I have suddenly seen
them all naked together round the table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In good company, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know the people whom you
speak of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be with them this evening,
Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders discontentedly
and tapped her foot on the carpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him and her eyes were
dark and angry. He took her hand and
held it fast in his:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen it in eyes that were looking
at you, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>She drew her hand away:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is hideous, Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and went to the balcony-door.
He looked after her and his eyes gleamed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood with her back to him, leaning
against the window-frame, and buttoned
her gloves. He leant forward and
gripped the arms of his chair with his
hands:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen it in <i>your</i> eyes, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not move, uttered not a word.
When she had finished buttoning her
gloves, she gathered up her train and went
out on the balcony.</p>

<p>The May air was cold and she shivered
in her thin gown. The lamps shone dimly
through the mist; many carriages drove
across the square. She could hear the
tinkling of the harness-bells in the gateway;
the footman was tramping up and
down below.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>She turned and stood at the window
and looked at Cordt. He had moved his
chair round towards the fireplace. She
could see nothing of him but one shoulder
and arm, his thick hair and his legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The carriage is there,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He rose and went to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not be angry with me,&#8221; he
said, gently. &#8220;I am out of sorts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... perhaps.... No, not that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, for all that I care, we can stay
at home. You have spoilt <i>my</i> pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you have. It was for you
I made myself look so nice ... it was
with you I wanted to go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand and drew her to the
fire:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Adelheid ... there ... only
for a minute. Shall we stay at home to-night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
... get some wine ... have a party
of our own...?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... you&#8217;re in such a festive
mood!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now be good, Adelheid. You are
my only dissipation.... You know you
are ... there have been hundreds of
delightful days to prove it. If you are
of my mind to-night, we will do this.
And you will be beautiful for me and
I for you and our eyes will sparkle together.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not look at him, but shook her
head:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will stay at home, if you wish it,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>They sat silent. The candles on the
mantelpiece flickered and guttered in the
draught.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is strange,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Do you remember
the evening in London, Adelheid,
when we were to go to that great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ball? Then I begged you to stay at
home and you did and you were glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay far back in her chair, with her
arms behind her neck:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not glad that evening,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>He raised his head and listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I submitted, Cordt, but I was not
glad to. I was acting a part, for your
sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>She met his eyes. Hers were still and
sad and she did not remove them while
she spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wicked, Cordt. I hated you. I
told you a lie. I was dancing at the ball,
hour after hour, while I sat and held your
hand and laughed so gaily.&#8221;</p>

<p>She slipped from her chair and crouched
before him, with her hands folded round
his knee and her eyes fixed humbly on his
face:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not look at me so strangely, Cordt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
That is how I am. I love you. But I
cannot live without the others ... without
having them to see it, to see my happiness.
I want to be pretty and I want
them to fall in love with me and I want
to belong to you. I only care to be pretty
if I am loved. Don&#8217;t look like that,
Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>She clung to him with eyes of entreaty.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not really wicked, Cordt ...
am I? I was with our little baby day
and night when he was ill ... wasn&#8217;t I,
Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... I was. But I cannot always
be quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted her from her chair and crossed
the room with his arm round her waist.
They went out on the balcony. A carriage
came across the square at a brisk
trot, followed soon after by a multitude
of others. They came from the streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
all round, but drove away in the same direction
and disappeared round a street-corner.
The horses&#8217; hoofs clattered
against the pavement, the lamps shone on
the glittering carriages, coachmen and
footmen sat stiff and black on their
boxes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Adelheid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let us
go.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The candles on the mantelpiece burnt
down and the faces in the big chairs
grinned in the darkness. When day
dawned, the old servant came and arranged
the room. When it was evening,
he lit the candles.</p>

<p>He did this the next day and the next
and many days after. The sun rose and
the sun set. The water splashed in the
fountain. The lamps shone and the
people swarmed over the square. The
balcony was bright with its red flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and, every evening, the light fell through
the open door.</p>

<p>But the summer passed and no one
entered the room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fru Adelheid</span> stood on the balcony.
She plucked the red flowers and threw
them into the square below. She wore a
long, white gown; her gloves and her white
boa lay on the ground. She had just come
from the theatre and had been bored.</p>

<p>Now she turned towards the room.</p>

<p>Cordt sat huddled together before the
fireplace and stared in front of him. She
wanted to see his face and called to him.
He pushed back his chair and looked up:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of the play we have
been to see,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew the other chair over the floor,
so that she could look at the jar with the
naked man writhing through thorns.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8220;There was a time when I was tired of
law,&#8221; said Cordt. &#8220;I was glad when the
poet showed me a marriage that was
broken for love. I used to think that
people grew greater through it and that
Heaven seemed higher and earth more
green.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shuddered again and wrapped her
skirt closer about her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I am so tired of lawlessness. I
loathe these women and their lovers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are married yourself now,&#8221; she
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up. She could see that he had
not caught her words and she was glad.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be a struggle, no doubt,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course there must. There is. In
the old days, they were not allowed to
come together and now they are not allowed
to stay together.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>She said nothing, but let her hand glide
over the jar.</p>

<p>&#8220;All these faithless wives have lowered
love. I could imagine a woman of refinement
stifling her love, because she
would not give it scope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she was afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she was refined.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat silent for a time and looked
at the live embers in the white ashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think there are many who do
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think there are many faithless
wives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Why shouldn&#8217;t there
be?&#8221;</p>

<p>He leant his head on his hands. Fru
Adelheid played with the jar.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t understand that people
care to go to the theatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where would you have them go?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>He pushed back his chair so that he
could see her. She remained sitting as
she sat and thought of nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I suppose you
wouldn&#8217;t care to stay at home to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>She lay back in her chair and looked at
her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I wanted to go out
to supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should so much like to talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I did come home from the theatre,
dear,&#8221; she replied and put out her hand
to him.</p>

<p>He did not see it and she let it fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have stayed at home
after the theatre, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see,&#8221; she answered and just
shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;I did not
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you understood it in the theatre.
And now you want to sup out all the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>He bent over to her to catch her eyes.
She said nothing and did not look at
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid knit her brow:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t go to the theatre, you see, for
the sake of the play,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That
does not amuse me. But it amuses me
to watch that sea of people and to hear
them clamor and then fall silent. I like
the way they clap and the way they are
quite still when anything good is being
said on the stage. Then something sings
inside me and I enjoy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment; then
he laughed and rubbed his hands. Fru
Adelheid turned her chair towards him,
so close that her knees touched his:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it that you wanted to talk
to me about this evening?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;That couldn&#8217;t be postponed until the
theatre was over? That couldn&#8217;t wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
for an hour, now that I feel like going
out to supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her and shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Was</i> it anything? Or were you only
tired and empty, as I was ... and as the
faithless wives are ... and the modern
poets and ... and everybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Adelheid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No. It
was nothing. Nothing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; she
said and suddenly flung herself violently
back in her chair. &#8220;There is something
behind your words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are angry with me. What is it
that I do? We live no differently, that
I know of, from other people in our circle.
We travel, we go to the theatre, we go out
and we receive our friends at home. We
meet amusing people, artists ... everybody
who is anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>&#8220;Are you always amused among amusing
people?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him a little doubtfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no such thing as always anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, &#8220;more&#8217;s the pity. There
is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat silent, both steeped in thought.
Then he pushed his hair from his forehead
and said, calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Try if you can understand me, Adelheid.
When a woman marries and becomes
a mother, she usually becomes
quiet ... quieter, I mean. I mean that
there are victories which she cannot win,
triumphs which she cannot achieve ...
which she does not trouble about. She
does not trouble about them, Adelheid,
because she has deepened her life ... because
she has come so near to one man
that the approach of other men is distasteful
to her. Then she becomes quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
... quieter. And this quietness is not
empty, but just richer than all the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him with a strangely inquisitive
flash in her angry eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you jealous?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head and made a gesture
of denial with his hand. But she sprang
from her chair and stood before him with
great, proud eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to be, Cordt,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You ought to be. I am yours and I love
you. You won me once: see to it that you
know how to keep me. Fight for me,
Cordt. I am young, I am pretty and the
world is full of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose deliberately and looked at her
till she thought for a moment that he
would strike her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be twenty-six next month,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;And, besides, we in our family
don&#8217;t fight to keep our wives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>She sat down without knowing what
she was doing. He looked at her and she
looked back at him. She could not help
thinking how tall he was; and how easily
he wore his clothes; and that one of his
shoulders was a little lower than the
other.</p>

<p>Then he crossed the room, so quickly
that he nearly tripped over the carpet.
He struggled with the old spinning-wheel
and pulled it over the floor. She followed
him with her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you spin on my great-grandmother&#8217;s
wheel, Adelheid?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She crossed her arms on her breast and
looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you, Adelheid? Couldn&#8217;t you
learn? Not if I begged you to?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pulled the spinning-wheel right in
front of her and placed it as if she were
to use it then and there. Then he sat
down in his chair again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you could, Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked hard at each other. Then
they became timid and shy and dropped
their eyes.</p>

<p>They both thought of holding out their
hands, but neither could see the other&#8217;s.
They longed to throw themselves into
each other&#8217;s arms, but they sat as
stiff as statues. Their lips trembled;
but they did not look at each other
and neither knew anything of the other&#8217;s
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thinking how very small we
look in these big chairs,&#8221; he said, at
last.</p>

<p>His voice was calm and she grew quite
calm at once. It was all over; there was
peace in their souls. It was not a reconciliation,
for they remembered no quarrel.
Their glances rested confidently upon
each other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>There was nothing between them and
they were friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if we are inferior to those
who sat here before us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Different,
yes; but inferior?&#8221;</p>

<p>They both rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much inferior,&#8221; said Cordt, &#8220;and
much less happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They crossed the room and went out on
the balcony, as was their custom before
they went to bed.</p>

<p>The stars of the September night rode
in a high sky. Most of the lamps were
extinguished and there were but few
people in the square. A drunken man
was singing far away. The sound of the
water falling in the fountain swelled up
in the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful it is here!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now the summer nights are over
and we have not enjoyed them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>She laid her head on his shoulder and
closed her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think that in the whole world
there is a square so pretty as this,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes ... in Florence....&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed and led her into the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have travelled too much, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed the floor quickly and opened
the door. He remained standing on the
balcony.</p>

<p>It had all seethed up in him again. He
fought against it, but to no purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you coming, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was outside in the passage and
could not see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you go.... I will come presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>He forced his voice to be as calm as
possible, but it sounded very unnatural
in his own ears. He stood quite still and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
listened. She remained standing for a
moment, as though she were considering.</p>

<p>Then she closed the door and went. He
could hear that she went hurriedly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first snow had fallen and lay fine
and white on the balcony, embroidered
by the feet of the sparrows.</p>

<p>The red flowers stood indoors, in the
warmth, and looked pitiful. And a big
table had been placed at the back of the
room, with a lamp upon it and a pile of
books.</p>

<p>Cordt came early.</p>

<p>He went straight up to the table, sat
down and opened a book. Soon after,
he stood at the window and looked out.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk. A damp and
misty evening, with a thin, reddish light
behind the mist and cold feet and dripping
roofs. The snow on the square had
melted into slush. The fountain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
silent, covered with boards and pine-faggots.</p>

<p>He sat down again and read. He stood
up, looked at his watch, went to the window,
walked up and down the floor and
sat down again. He lit a cigar and let it
go out. He went away and came back
in an hour and began all over again.</p>

<p>A little before midnight, the carriage
drove in through the gateway and, five
minutes later, Fru Adelheid stood in the
room, tall and white, with large eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you enjoyed yourself, Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p>She could hear that he did not care to
know and she did not answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am freezing,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She drew her chair close up to the fire,
nestled into it and put her feet on the
fender.</p>

<p>&#8220;They asked after you, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>He turned over the leaves of his book
a little, then closed it and drew his chair
beside hers. He sat resting his cheek in
his hand and looked tired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you intend to sit in this room all
day, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, only in the evening. When I
have nothing else to do. I love this
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed her hands hard together
and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;All the unkindness
that has come between you and
me comes from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said nothing to this, but rose and
went to the table for a cigar. Something
went through her as he slammed the lid
of the box.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going with me to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want to cut off all our acquaintance,
Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I do not. But I don&#8217;t
care to go out just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think our friends will
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them say what they like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you consider how unpleasant it
is for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. But I don&#8217;t care to go out at
present.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lit his cigar at the candle on the
mantel-shelf. Then he sat down again
and smoked quietly and looked into the
fire. She looked at him and sighed.</p>

<p>And, without knowing how it happened
and without intending it, she suddenly felt
her heart touched and her eyes grew moist:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not happy, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up and gazed at her:</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is my fault? Because your
wife is a silly woman, who wants to go
out every day?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>&#8220;You are not that, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I am an empty, restless,
modern creature?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I then, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand and kissed it and
smiled to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my wife, Adelheid. And
we have a little baby, we two, and perhaps
will have another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said and drew her hand
away. &#8220;No, Cordt. That was only my
nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said nothing. His hand fell down
slackly and he turned paler than she could
remember ever having seen him. She
was afraid that he was ill and stooped over
him and called to him.</p>

<p>He did not see her, did not hear her.</p>

<p>She could not take her eyes from him.
She thought he could not look more distressed
if their boy were dead. She felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
it as an appalling shame, that she herself
was glad of it; and she dreaded lest he
should look at her.</p>

<p>Then he did and read her thoughts.</p>

<p>And she grew worse and worse the more
she saw him grieve. She did not understand
it, felt troubled by it.</p>

<p>And, as there was no anger in his
eyes, it grew worse for her still. She cast
about for a word that could make him
move and say something, no matter
what.</p>

<p>But he sat still and silent and slowly
turned his face away from her. And she
could find nothing to say.</p>

<p>She rose and went to the window and
stood there for a while. Then she came
back and sat down in a chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again they sat silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>He spoke her name quite calmly and
gently, but she was frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will fight for you, Adelheid; I mean
to fight for you; and the new little baby
would have helped me. Now I shall
have to fight alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>She remembered vaguely that this
phrase had once been uttered between
them, but she did not understand him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will stake life and happiness to win
you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will talk to you and
importune you and conquer you. I will
take you in my arms and close my door
against you and run after you and forgive
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, if you don&#8217;t win me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall win you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>if</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at his mouth, while she
listened for the answer. It came quite
calmly; he did not even look at her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall cast you off.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Fru Adelheid closed her eyes tightly
and then opened them wide:</p>

<p>&#8220;Better cast me off at once, Cordt. If
you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. We have the baby. And
we are fond of each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;What don&#8217;t you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer, only shook her
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall have your liberty,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Go out as much as you please, amuse
yourself, fill the house with guests. Be
gay and melancholy the whole day long,
as your fate decides. Go away, if you
feel inclined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And will you never go with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As little as possible. I will not fight
for you out there. I won you there once
and I am not afraid for you ... that way.
There, in any case, I need not trouble to
win you again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will know that you can find
me here any evening. Here is where I
shall live.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and walked slowly through the
room. Fru Adelheid let herself slip to
the floor and lay there with her cheek on
the fender and stared before her. She
saw him return and stand beside her and
go and come back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I shall never come
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do about that as you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down and rested his head on his
hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;My ancestor well knew what he was
doing, when he built this sacred nuptial
secret chamber in his rich, new house ...
high above the street, far from the day&#8217;s
work ... and the night&#8217;s. He saw deep
and far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the torture-chamber of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
house,&#8221; said Fru Adelheid. &#8220;I am certain
that many women have wept bitterly
in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He half rose in his seat and passed his
hand over his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am frightened, Cordt. You want
to ill-use me. I can&#8217;t do what you wish.
Shall we talk somewhere else ... in your
room, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our place is here.
Here we are bound to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up and sat down again at
once. His eyes glittered as he spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they all sat, the men who lived
in the house and their wives ... in joy
and in sorrow. Their faces look at us
from every corner, their words whisper
all around.... Can you not hear my
great-grandmother&#8217;s spinning-wheel?...
Do you not hear the spinet singing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here our words become greater and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
weightier in the stillness. Here we grow
more powerful in our affection and our
anger. Whatever we can do we can do
here. They knew something, those old,
big men and women.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and stood before him, leaning
against the mantel, tall and white:</p>

<p>&#8220;They knew how to keep discipline in
their house,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She looked at him and there was pride
and fear and anger about her red mouth
and in her strange eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That they did,&#8221; he said. &#8220;God bless
them for it in their graves!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down in the old chair and put
her arms around the jar, where the man
writhed through thorns. She stared at the
man&#8217;s face and it was as though she were
with him and felt the thorns in her flesh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here also it was that we two bound
ourselves to each other for good and all,
Adelheid. That evening when we put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
our names to the old yellow paper there,
in the wall. Then you pledged yourself
to this room, which you hate. And,
when the time comes, our son will come
here with the woman who shall be his
joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out on the balcony and came
back, white and wet with snow. He
brought the cold in with him and she
shivered. He stood silent by the fire and
then began to walk about again. She
listened to his step and waited for a word
and could find nothing to say.</p>

<p>Then she went to the old spinet and
sat down and sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">My Lenore, how dark and drear</div>
<div class="indent">The burden of daylight&#8217;s bringing!</div>

<div class="verse">Kiss me, Lenore, and kiss me again</div>
<div class="indent">And give me a thousand kisses</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The slender tones sang through the
room, when she stopped.</p>

<p>She listened, but could not hear his
footstep. He was sitting in one of the
big chairs and did not move.</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment over
her shoulder. Then she rose and closed
the instrument, with as much noise as she
could:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she turned very red and very pale
and went away with moist and angry eyes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fru Adelheid</span> was icy cold and had
drawn her chair as near the chimney as
she could.</p>

<p>It blazed and flared in there; the red
glow scorched her face and her white
gown. But she kept on adding logs to
the fire and could not get warm.</p>

<p>Cordt sat in the other chair reading,
with his book on his knees and his head
leaning on his hands. The book was a
large one, with yellow pages and old-fashioned
characters.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid looked at him despondently.
She regretted that she had come
up to the room and would have gone away,
had she had the strength to. She sighed
and looked into the fire with tired eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>&#8220;Adelheid ... listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed his hair with both hands
from his forehead and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;But, when the tidings came to Queen
Thyre that Olav Trygvasson was dead,
she fell into a swoon and lay thus for long.
And, when, at the last, she came to herself
again, she was so sorrowful that it
was pity for those of her house to behold.
When the day was over, she went to a
monk who dwelled near by and was known
in all that land for a holy man. Him she
asked if folk who died by their own
hands sinned against God&#8217;s law; since
her lord and husband was dead and she
had no more liking for life. But the
monk answered and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Indeed it is a sin. For God has
given us life and will take it back again
when He thinks right.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the queen wept, because she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
must sin so grievously. But, early the
next morning, she came again and asked
the holy man how little one was allowed
to eat without angering God. And the
monk took pity on her and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you eat an apple every day, that
will be enough.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Queen Thyre lay down on her
couch and bade all her handmaidens
leave her, so that she might be alone with
her dule and sorrow, bidding them that
one of her maidens, whom she best loved,
was to bring her each morning an apple
in the golden cup from which she was
wont to take her morning draught. And
so it fell that, when the maiden came on
the morning of the ninth day with the apple
in the golden cup, the queen was in
Heaven with her husband.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>He closed the book; his lips moved as
though he were repeating the words to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
himself. Fru Adelheid looked thoughtfully
into the fire. Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all very well for those old,
dead people. They always had a holy
man to whom they could go in their
distress.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Cordt shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You distort the chronicle, Adelheid,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It was not at all like that.
The queen wanted to die and she died.
She went to the monk to be released from
sin and piously subjected herself to his
command.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They had God, in those days,&#8221; said
Fru Adelheid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they had. The old, strong God
held them in His hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose quickly and stood by the chimney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe in God, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;I do not. But
I believe that He once existed. And I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
think that it would be a good thing if He
were here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so too.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his foot on the fender and folded
his hands over his knee:</p>

<p>&#8220;God is somewhere still. And I do
not fear His mighty face. If ever I come
to look upon it, then I daresay I shall see
all that was high and glorious for me in
my days, all that made my blood red and
my back straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid smiled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the old, strong God, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at her face, but there was
nothing there to rouse his anger. Then he
crossed the room and stood beside her
again with the same expression in his
eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;The old, strong God,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
myself can do well enough without Him.
But I need Him in my house.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>She laid her head back in her chair and
laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Cordt. That you certainly
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she kept on laughing and said
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I daresay that wouldn&#8217;t have
happened with ... what was his name,
who robbed you down below, in the counting-house?
Do you think so, Cordt?
And then your wife would kiss your hand
every morning and ask to know her stern
lord&#8217;s commands.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked up and down and did not
answer.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid understood that he paid
no attention to her sally, because her
words were too small for his thoughts and
she was displeased with herself and angry
with him:</p>

<p>&#8220;But, to come back to the story, surely
there are also Hagbarth and Signe,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
said. &#8220;Not to speak of Romeo and
Juliet. And Maria Veczera ... and Elvira
Madigan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt continued his walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say anything against it. It is
a beautiful story. And perhaps it is true
besides. In any case, it is right to place
a good example before the young. But,
as for Queen Thyre, it surely depends
a little upon how long she had been Fru
Trygvasson.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not so much as look at her. She
felt that she was being treated as a child
whom one does not trouble to answer and
she worked herself up into a steadily increasing
passion and sought for words to
wound him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Every love passes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That
we know. It is all very well for those
who die first. They show up prettily in
history; but there is nothing to prove that
they were better than the rest of us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Cordt was still walking. Now he stood
over by the window and looked out.
Then he began to walk again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped before her chair and looked
at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how long King Olav and
Queen Thyre were married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the point of all this, Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p>She pushed back her chair and stood
up. She was not able to say at once what
she wished, but took a step towards him
and sat down again and felt quite powerless.</p>

<p>Then there was something in his glance
that helped her. And she drew herself
up and looked him firmly in the face:</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that you are sitting here and
growing musty in old books and old stuff
and nonsense, while life is taking its
course around you. In time, your beard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
will grow fast to the table and you will
never speak a word, except once every
ten years, and then it will be so wise and
deep that no one will understand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no danger of that, Adelheid,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to be Queen Thyre
or Signe or any of them,&#8221; she said; and
her voice was so hard that something
gave a wrench inside him. &#8220;I want to be
the woman I am, the woman you fell in
love with and took in your arms. I am
not in a book. They will never read about
me in the girls&#8217; schools. I have no time
to spare for this endless old drab affection
beyond the grave. I don&#8217;t understand
it, I don&#8217;t believe in it. I want the wild,
red love....&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt had turned his face from her,
while she was speaking. Now he looked
at her again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got it, Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>She lay back in her chair and gave him
a strange look. He had never seen those
eyes before. Veil after veil fell over them,
till they were quite dark, and then there
suddenly lighted in them a gleam that was
gone at the same moment and the veils
fell again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She said it so softly that he could only
just hear. He listened a moment whether
she would say any more.</p>

<p>Then he bowed his head, so that his
thick hair fell over his forehead, and
threw it back again and turned very
pale:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He slowly crossed the room to the window
and stood with his forehead against
the panes. And slowly Fru Adelheid
turned her face to him and back again to
the fire.</p>

<p>It did not seem to her as though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
had said it; and then, the next moment,
she heard his quiet answer and saw his
face, which was so terribly stern and white.
She knew that it was not what she meant
to say and she knew that it was true. She
felt a bitter remorse at having hurt the
man she loved, a senseless despair at not
being able to make amends.</p>

<p>Then all this was dissolved in anger
that he had led her on to speak like that.
And the anger died away in a profound,
soft pity for herself.</p>

<p>She saw deeper into her own soul than
she had ever done before and turned dizzy
with what she saw. She was seized with
a wild and curious longing and bent lower
over the well. Then it seemed to her as
though she were falling and she gripped
the arms of the chair so tightly that her
knuckles turned white.</p>

<p>And behind the terror was the distant
bird, that sang ... a green and golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
land, which she had never seen in her
dreams....</p>

<p>Cordt stood before her and put out his
hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Adelheid,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She sat straight up and looked at him
in bewilderment:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But I should like you to go to bed.
I shall stay here a little longer and read.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down and took his book. Fru
Adelheid rose slowly and went across the
room.</p>

<p>At the door, she stood for a moment and
looked at him. His face was very still.
It seemed to her as though he were far
away. She wondered whether he would
look up and say good-night once more.
Or only nod.</p>

<p>But he was reading and turning the
pages of his book.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fire in the hearth was nearly out
and the candles had burnt quite low.
It was quiet in the room and quiet outside.</p>

<p>Cordt sat in his chair. He had been
sitting there long and had not stirred, only
pondered, with his fingers buried in his
hair, and listened for Fru Adelheid&#8217;s
footsteps.</p>

<p>She was at home, had been at home
the whole week. But she had not set
foot in the room for the last fortnight.</p>

<p>Cordt looked at his watch. Then he
rose and left the room, left the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A little later, Fru Adelheid came.</p>

<p>She remained standing at the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
surprised to find the room empty. She
called to the balcony, but no one answered.
Lingeringly, she went to the
window and looked out. There was no
one there.</p>

<p>She turned quickly to go. Then the
thought came to her of what it had cost
her to come up here; and she was annoyed
that Cordt was not there. But that was
only for a moment; then she was happy
again at escaping the encounter. She
felt in a lighter mood than she had for
many days.</p>

<p>She looked about her curiously. She
had never been alone in the room and
she seemed not to have seen it properly
before.</p>

<p>She stood long in front of the old chairs,
lost in contemplation of the strange faces
in the woodwork. She pushed them
round the floor, placed them opposite
each other and beside each other and sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
down in them as though to try what it was
like. She summoned up in her memory
all that she knew about those who had
sat in them and amused herself with
imagining what one had said and the
other.</p>

<p>Then she went to the celestial globe and
looked at it. She pressed the spring, so
that the stars ran and shone. She looked
with delight at the queer plaything and,
when the clockwork stopped, set it in
motion again.</p>

<p>She pulled out the old spinning-wheel
and sat down beside it and set it going.
The wheel whirred lustily in the silent
room and its whirring put Fru Adelheid in
a very cheerful mood. She wished the
great-grandmother would come in at the
door and praise her for being so industrious.</p>

<p>She rose from the spinning-wheel and
stood in the middle of the room and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
round. She thought of an occasion when
she had stood in an Indian temple and
reflected that she was examining these
singular old things just as calmly as she
had contemplated the Hindu sanctuary.</p>

<p>It seemed to her as though she were
standing in a mortuary chapel, where old
and interesting, but foolish ideas and
preposterous superstitions stared at her
from the sunken faces of mummies. She
felt no terror, for she knew that all that
was dead and gone and could never
return.</p>

<p>Her eyes fell on the light stain on the
wall, where the portrait had hung.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Fru Lykke!&#8221; she said, aloud.
&#8220;You were shut out of the temple, because
your husband deceived you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she lifted her arms in the air in
jubilant gladness that she was born in
gentler times and still lived and felt the
warm blood beating in her heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Fru Adelheid went round the room and
laughed aloud to think how easily she had
broken the spell of the old room. She
patted the big chairs on their stiff backs
and talked kindly to them. She used to
hate them; her blood had turned to ice
each time she sat in them. Now they were
two handsome, valuable chairs and nothing
more.</p>

<p>She had torn the veil from the Holy of
Holies. There was nothing behind it.</p>

<p>She ran to the window and pulled the
curtain aside with a jerk.</p>

<p>There sat the doll ... stiff and stupid.</p>

<p>She laid her face on its waxen cheek
and kissed it with her red mouth.</p>

<p>Humming a tune, she sat down to the
old spinet. She sought for a hymn that
should celebrate her victory over the
ghost.</p>

<p>But, when she struck the first notes, she
suddenly grew frightened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>She had an uncomfortable feeling that
there was some one in the room.</p>

<p>She sprang up, so that the chair upset,
and looked around her.</p>

<p>There was no one.</p>

<p>The candles were all burnt out but one
and it was dark in every corner. Now the
last candle flickered up and struggled a
little and went out.</p>

<p>And then there came a treacherous and
threatening muttering and whispering all
round the room.</p>

<p>People passed over the floor ... many
and heavy footsteps. The spinning-wheel
whirred, the spinet sang behind her back.
The stars ran and shone, the doll rocked at
her. The faces in the old chairs raised
themselves on their long necks and pecked
at her and grinned uncannily.</p>

<p>But the man who writhed through
thorns called for help.... She could hear
him call. He grew bigger ... he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
nearer.... She saw the blood drip from
his naked limbs....</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid crept to the door with
quivering hands and fearful eyes.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fru Adelheid</span> laid her hands over
Cordt&#8217;s book:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I talk to you a little? May I
tell you something? May I tell you that
what you are doing is madness?&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved her hands from his book and
looked up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Adelheid,&#8221; he said wearily.
&#8220;Sit down in that chair.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she took the book from him and
threw it on the floor:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ill, Cordt. You have become
ill up here in this dreadful room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you a household remedy?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you have the heart to make
a jest of it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;It would be a bitter jest, if it were
one,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it was not a jest.
I believe in the old household remedies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sat down in her chair
and stared helplessly before her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And
in old books and in everything that has
ceased to exist.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said nothing, but yawned wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And God shall be set on His throne
again and I shall sit at the spinning-wheel
and we shall enjoy a blessed married life
and be happy ever after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt crossed his legs and looked at his
nails:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... that is my programme,&#8221; he
said quietly. &#8220;Something like that. And
you have stated it in your usual affectionate
manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt, how can you have the heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>She swung her body to and fro; her
hands lay folded in her lap, her eyes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
moist. She wanted to say something,
but could not, because the tears prevented
her. She could not understand
that he did not help her. Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Things are going badly with us,
Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, as he was still silent, she pulled
herself together with an effort and spoke
with closed eyes, constantly rocking to
and fro:</p>

<p>&#8220;We must obey the law under which
we were born ... must we not, Cordt?
After all, we are modern people ... both
of us. Tired, empty people, if you like.
But we do think and feel otherwise than
people did when ... when they were the
sort of people whom you like. And we
cannot alter ourselves. But we can be
as happy as it is possible to be ... nowadays,
being what we are. Why should
we not be happy, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not happy.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed her hands together and
wrung them and bent over them so that
her tears fell upon them. Then she
turned her wet face to him and asked,
softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then am I no longer pretty, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up and kissed her white forehead:</p>

<p>&#8220;That you are,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But that
won&#8217;t help us any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to walk up and down. Fru
Adelheid wept hard and silently. A
little later, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are driving me away from you,
Cordt. I do so want to tell you this,
while there is still time, if only I could find
the right words. Won&#8217;t you sit down a
little, Cordt? My head aches so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down in the chair. Then she
rose and put some wood on the fire and
sat down again:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8220;I am so afraid of myself when we talk
together, Cordt,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is not
only that I am wicked and say what I do
not mean. I do that, too. But you are
so good. And you show me thoughts
in my mind which are not there before
you utter them. But then they come
and I think that you are right and that
they have been there always. That is
so terrible, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>They sat silent. Fru Adelheid closed
her eyes; Cordt moved restlessly in his
chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid,&#8221; he said.... &#8220;You told
me that evening....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not say that ... you must
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember, you said ...
about the wild, red love ... that it was
not the love which you have?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook his hand and pressed it:</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
grateful to you because you were so good.
And because you did not take it ill. But
that was not in me, Cordt. I did not
know it. But then you said it ... and
made me say ... what I said. But then,
at that very moment, I understood that it
was so. And that made me feel so terribly
bad ... as I did. But then I felt a sort
of secret joy ... a secret treasure. It
seemed to me that I was richer than before.
I was no longer afraid of what
may come ... for women sometimes
think of that, Cordt, while they are young,
how empty everything will be, when that
is past.&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened, with his face turned to the
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that there is not a man who
can understand that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>And then she lay down on the floor,
with her chin on the fender ... and her
eyes shone:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;A woman is young for so short a
time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And she is always
dreading that it will pass. Can&#8217;t you
understand, when she suddenly suspects
that there is something greater than the
greatest ... and then, when she is sad
and afraid ... that then it may suddenly
dawn upon her that all is not over
yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a poor pleasure to be the greatest
when there is something greater still,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>But Fru Adelheid shook her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that, Cordt,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair and walked
up and down many times and it was silent
in the room. Then he sat down again
beside her and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What you say is true. But it <i>was</i> in
you and I am glad I showed it to you.
I could not do differently, when I once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
saw it. I cannot go and wait until another
man knocks at the secret door of
your heart and offers you the greatest of
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid her cheek against the fender
and looked at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Cordt,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If it is like
that, then what I said was not true.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hand and shook his head
impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-day or to-morrow,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But in a year, or two years, or ten.
And, if it does not happen, then it is only
an accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she moved nearer to him and
laid her head on his knee. She looked
up to see if he minded. But he was far
away in his thoughts and did not notice it.</p>

<p>She suddenly felt peaceful and contented.
She was glad that she had got
it said. She felt as if it was removed to
a distance ... perhaps it was quite gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
... she could not understand why he
continued to speak of it.</p>

<p>And what he said about another man
seemed so far to her and so impossible.
She thought about it as though it concerned
somebody else:</p>

<p>&#8220;I love you, Cordt,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And,
if, one day, another man came and I
loved him ... could I help it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang up so suddenly that she had
to seize the arm of the chair lest she should
fall:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, scornfully. &#8220;You could
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rushed through the room and repeated
his words three or four times.
Fru Adelheid rose from the floor and sat
down in her chair and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who hit upon that excuse
did a fine day&#8217;s work,&#8221; said Cordt.
&#8220;He drove out of the world a great portion
of men&#8217;s strength to live their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>He threw himself so violently into his
chair that Fru Adelheid started. Then
he sat long quiet and she was glad that
he was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should one not be able to control
one&#8217;s heart?&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;Suppose
I have a wife and child; and my wife
is she whom I myself chose. Then, one
day, I meet another woman, who rouses
my desires. I meet her at a party, where
there are lights and wine and music ...
we are not ourselves, she and I ... we
are in another mood than usual ...
everything is done to lead us from the
way by which we go on ordinary days.
But why should I not be able to step
aside, in loyal gratitude for that which
I possess?&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened her eyes at intervals and
closed them again. She heard what he
said, but did not realize that he was speaking
to her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8220;Who is it that placed love outside the
laws? If I take it into my head to kill a
fellow-creature, there is no doubt but
that I am indulging a most criminal
fancy. If I have given my word and think
of breaking it, I am no gentleman. But
my heart may do as it pleases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Fru Adelheid.</p>

<p>She was thinking of nothing when she
spoke and he did not hear her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are people, we know, who have
the right to send thousands to their
death,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are people
whose passion rises skywards in red
flames and devours the poor chattels that
stand in its way and lights up all the land.
Poets sing about it and a wax taper burns
before its image in every human heart.
But, if a man plays the Napoleon in the
Store Bröndstræde, we hang him ...
Why should every second woman be entitled
to look upon herself as an Héloïse?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>He sank into his chair and stared before
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not sure either whether the radiance
of the one great flame makes up
for the thousand tiny lights that are put
out. Does any one know, I wonder?
Can any one measure it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid moved and Cordt turned
his face to her and looked at her attentively.
Her eyes were soft and dreamy;
she smiled faintly, like a drowsy child.</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>if</i> that be so,&#8221; he said, in a subdued
voice, &#8220;if it be the case that I am
not able to control my heart....&#8221; He
let his head fall heavily on the arm of the
chair. &#8220;<i>If</i> it be the case that love makes
me happy and confident, so that I build
my life and the life of my family upon it
... if it can then expire, without my
knowing how or why, and I have to
look for the mother of my children in
a strange man&#8217;s bed, then why do I let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
my wife go out in the street unveiled?
Why do I not lock her up, as the Turk
does? Or why do we not kill the mother
when the child is born?&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and walked round the room
and grew calmer as he walked:</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is not so,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let the
great keep their greatness ... let the
poets celebrate them and the puny moderns
ape them in their wretched way.
And may there always be women who
cannot give themselves more than once
and men who love them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood by the fire and looked through
the room. It was still on every side; the
church-clock struck two.</p>

<p>&#8220;See, Adelheid,&#8221; he said, &#8220;how life
passes more and more into law&#8217;s domain.
Every day, the liberty of the one is taken
for an encroachment upon the rights of
the other. Every day, land, hitherto free
of law, is regulated by law. Flowers beget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
no flowers without the gardener&#8217;s consent;
animals no longer select their own
mates. But no one can control his heart;
and human beings pair like dogs in the
street.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fire had burnt out when Cordt
woke from his musings.</p>

<p>He saw that Fru Adelheid was asleep.
He stood before her a long time, sick with
compassion for her and for himself.</p>

<p>Then he stroked her gently on the hair:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is late ... Adelheid.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">&#8220;I could</span> wish we were not married,
Cordt,&#8221; said Fru Adelheid.</p>

<p>She laid her arms across her breast and
looked at him with deep, dark eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;I could wish I were your mistress. If
it meant that, all would be over and done
with in the morning. Then there would
be no more of this unpleasantness. And
no fear, either. And the joys we have
would be all the fairer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood by the fire and played with
the keys in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your forehead would be smooth
and your eyes bright, Cordt, for then you
would be making love to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up and said gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I make love to you, Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>She sighed and said nothing. Cordt
sat down in his chair and time passed.
Then he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear what I say, Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am longing to hear what you will
say next.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I read something similar to what you
have been saying in a book lately,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I forget what the book was called.
I was looking into it ... just where the
author railed against marriage, with its
security and its habits and all that. I
have read exactly the same thing in a
hundred books, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... they all sing the same song,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;It is not particularly entertaining.
But it is true enough, I daresay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt struck his hands together lightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is curious how little imagination
the poets have nowadays,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One
would think there were only half a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
women, whom they have all kissed and
married and run away from. I wonder
that it never occurs to one of them to
glorify <i>custom</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt pulled his chair forward and sat
with his head in his hands and looked
into the fire:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were a poet, I would sing a song
in honour of sacred custom,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes ... that I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid his head back and listened to
the gale whistling in the chimney:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now just look, Adelheid, at two people
thrown into each other&#8217;s arms by the
strongest power on earth. For them there
exists neither day nor night, neither time
nor place. The whole earth is fragrant
with violets. Their joy is terror and their
terror is full of exultant gladness. Then
a child lies in her lap and the light in her
eyes is deeper than before. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the years go by ... there are fewer violets
on the earth as the years go by, Adelheid.
She bears her children in pain.
And the pain sears her cheek. The
children have sucked her breast dry; her
eyes are weary with the night-watches.
The stranger who passes the house sees
only the faded woman. But he who drank
intoxication from her young eyes and
kissed the strength of her bosom ... he
does not see it. He has grown <i>accustomed</i>
to that woman. She has quenched the
longing of his youth and given him
peaceful happiness instead.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a while. Then he
turned his face towards her:</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not live in his first eager
longing for the trysting-hour, but confidently
seeks his accustomed couch by
her side. Custom has gently bound the
two people into one family. Is that not
beautiful, Adelheid? And good?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is beautiful, as
you tell it. But it is not youth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what is youth, Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Youth is not rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then one should not marry before
one is old,&#8221; said Cordt. &#8220;For marriage
is rest. Deep, powerful, happy ... generating
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No more one should,&#8221; replied Fru
Adelheid. &#8220;And that is why I could
wish I were your mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, as she said this, and
he at her.</p>

<p>Then he stood up and laid his hand
on the back of her chair and bent close
down to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;How far estranged from each other
we have become!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And Fru Adelheid nodded sadly and
Cordt crossed the room and stood by the
fire again:</p>

<p>&#8220;In vain I pitch my call in every key,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
he said. &#8220;It has availed me nothing that
my ancestor built this room ... his heirs
have borne witness here, generation after
generation, to no purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gust of wind came and blew the
balcony-door open.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid shuddered and looked
that way, while Cordt went and closed it.
Then he remained standing by the celestial
globe and pressed the spring:</p>

<p>&#8220;I so often think of the poor man who
placed this toy up here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
was a man who could not be content with
the circle in which he moved. So he lost
his reason and devoted himself to playing
with the stars.... For us modern
people it is different ... the other way
round. We go mad because the circle in
which we move is too large. We leave
the stars to the babies. We play ball with
bigger things. We try a fall with God
Himself, if the fancy takes us ... provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that we have not outgrown that
plaything too! We dare not speak of
love and we smile at marriage. We despise
courage and do not believe in honesty
and each of us has his own opinion
about virtue.&#8221;</p>

<p>She heard what he said even as people
listen to music when it does not so very
much matter if they catch every note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it happens that we long for a
fixed point in our lives ... just one point.
Something that cannot be pulled to pieces
and discussed. And something that is
not past.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt sat and moved about in his chair
and could not settle down:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were to put anything in this
room,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it would be a little tiny
house ... from far away in the country.
There would be only one door and two
windows and it would be evening and the
smoke would rise up gently from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
chimney. The house would have to be
as small as could be; but that would
show that there was no room for doubt
inside it. Husband and wife would go
in and out of the door to the end of their
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now she heard what he said and looked
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what my marriage ought to
be, Adelheid. If I had had any talent, I
daresay it would have been different. Or
if I had to work for my bread.... And
I am no different from other men of to-day
... no stronger, no braver. I know
nothing about God and I have no excessive
belief in men.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had lowered his voice and spoke
without looking at her. But she understood
that he was listening for a word
from her and her heart wept because she
had nothing to say to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My fixed point,&#8221; he said.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>Then he was silent for a little. But,
soon after, he rose and stood with his
arm on the back of her chair and spoke
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;There was also something in what I
used to see at home. Father and mother
were so kind ... and so strong. I see
them before me now, as they used to kiss
each other after dinner, however numerous
the company might be. And they
kissed each other good-morning and good-night
until they died. And when father
and his brother met in the street, they
always kissed ... people used to laugh
... and it was such a pretty habit.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he spoke, she sought for an opportunity
to interrupt him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My family-feeling has always been
too strong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Until now. And
yet ... I once had a sweetheart....&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped. Fru Adelheid sat up and
looked at him. Her eyes shone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;Or a connection, if you like....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never told me about that!&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>Cordt raised his head and looked at
her and she lowered her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to tell,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then he said no more, but went to the
window and stood there.</p>

<p>And Fru Adelheid again felt small and
ill at ease in the big old chair.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Cordt</span> stood on the threshold and
waited, but then closed the door and went
to the fire.</p>

<p>He was in dress-clothes and tired and
pale and his eyes were bright with wine.
When he had been sitting for a little
while, it grew too warm for him and he
drew his chair to the balcony-door. There
he sat and let his hands play with the red
flowers.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid did not see him when she
entered.</p>

<p>She moved slowly and stopped in the
middle of the room, when she discovered
that he was not by the fireplace. She was
surprised at this, but soon forgot it, in
her gayety and her lingering excitement
at the evening&#8217;s entertainment, with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
mind full of bright and clever phrases
and the lights gleaming in her great eyes.</p>

<p>She sat down to the spinet and laid her
forehead against the keys. Something
was singing inside her; her foot softly
beat the carpet.</p>

<p>Then she sought among the music and
sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>She put one hand on the music-sheet
and played with the other and hummed
the tune again.</p>

<p>Then Cordt clapped his hands in applause.
She started and her hand fell
heavily on the keyboard:</p>

<p>&#8220;How you frightened me, Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p>He came and stood beside the spinet.
Fru Adelheid looked at his face and
sighed. Then she stood up, put the music
away and went and sat in a chair by the
fireplace:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come here, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt walked to and fro again and up
and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down here for a little,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You are
not here, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up and met his calm eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still down below, among the
crowd of our guests. Don&#8217;t you know
that, Adelheid? They are all empty carriages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
that drove out at the gate. For, as
each one came to shake hands and say
good-bye, you entreated him to stay a
little longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sighed and crossed her
hands in her lap. He stood up by the
fireplace so that he could see her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sitting over there among the
flowers, when you came in, and I saw it
all. You entered with a gleam and a
rustle, accompanied by the whole throng
... you were the fairest of them all. By
your side went Martens, supple and handsome.
A long way after came his wife
... the woman who wears those tired
eyes and that painful smile. She did
not even look to see to whom he was
offering his homage.&#8221;</p>

<p>She puckered her forehead and looked
at him angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he begged you to sing the song
once more and they crowded round you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and added their entreaties to his. You
crossed the floor ... with your slow,
sure gait.... You always walk in the
same way, Adelheid ... like one who is
not to be stopped. Your white dress
trailed behind you; there was silence in
the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt ceased for a moment. Fru
Adelheid laid her head back in the chair
and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you sang ... his song ... the
one you were singing a minute ago at
the old spinet.... Yes, you heard me
applauding, Adelheid. He stood beside
you and looked at you ... deferentially,
happily. And you looked at him to read
in his eyes how charming you were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How wicked you make it all seem!&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>Cordt bent over her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at me, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him and was afraid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>&#8220;How dare you come up here with
your retinue?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Up here ...
to me ... in this room? Look at me,
Adelheid. Is there not room enough in
the house besides? Are there not a
hundred houses in the town where you
can play the game you love?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid stretched out her hands
to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p>But his eyes were large and stern and
she could not bear to look into them.</p>

<p>Then she rose and stood before him
with bowed head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go, Cordt?&#8221; she asked, softly.</p>

<p>He did not answer, but crossed the
room. And Fru Adelheid sat down on
the edge of the big chair, as if she were
not at home in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... Martens,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were not at all friendly to him
this evening, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>She said this in order to say something
and without thinking, but regretted it at
the same moment and looked at him dejectedly.
But he made a gesture with
his hand and answered, calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I was. As friendly as he
could wish and a great deal more so than
I feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood by the mantel and looked
down before him. She took his hand and
laid her cheek against it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Martens is nothing to me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Cordt. &#8220;Not really. It is
not the man ... it is men. It has not
gone so far as that. But it has gone
farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you,&#8221; she said,
sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a man, a good man or a bad
one, that is wooing your heart and has
won or is trying to win it. Martens is
not my rival. He does not love you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
he is not trying to make you believe that
he is. He does not lie. That is not called
for nowadays, except among the lower
classes. With us, we rarely see so much
as the shade of a scandal. Whence should
we derive the strength that is needed for
a rupture, a separation, a flight from society?
It&#8217;s a soldier that tells his girl
that she is his only love ... a journeyman
smith that kills his faithless sweetheart
... a farm-girl that drowns herself
when her lover jilts her for another.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew away his hand and folded his
arms across his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Martens is no Don Juan. It is not
his passion that infatuates women, not
his manly courage and strength that wins
them. He carries his desires to the back-streets;
he takes his meals with his wife.
He cannot love. The women become
his when he covets them, but he has never
belonged to any woman. His eyes, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
words, his ditties sing love&#8217;s praises with
a charming, melancholy languor which
no woman can resist. Then he lays his
head in her lap and tells her of his perpetual
yearnings and his perpetual disappointments.
He unbosoms himself to her
and begs her not to betray him. Then
she loves him. And she is his ... to
any extent he pleases.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tried to speak; but Cordt shook his
head in denial and she sighed and was
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is no longer young. But that
makes no difference. He was never
young. His unbounded susceptibility,
his eternal readiness make him young in
the women&#8217;s eyes, as though he were a
woman in man&#8217;s clothing. His limp sensuousness
has permeated every fibre of
his body and his soul ... so much so
that it affects his every word, look and
thought. He is destitute of will and insipid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and sickly and untrustworthy. He
is never hungry and he is insatiable. He
swallows women and spits them out again
... with morbid longings and a despondent
temper and a diminished strength to
live their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt!... Cordt!... What is he to
me?... What is he to us?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her and was silent for a
moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Martens tends the garden in which you
pluck your flowers. He is the chief gardener.
But he is only one of a thousand.
In the main, these passion-hunters are all
alike. Shall I introduce them to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do so without hurting the feelings
of any of them by mentioning their
names,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You will recognize
them all. You will recognize them at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>But Cordt did not hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will remember the man of whom
we all know that he has many mistresses,
even though we can say nothing to his
face. He often takes a new one. Then
he has one more ... that is all ... for
he never lets go the old ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is the man who tells his
fair friends that he has only loved one
woman in his life and that is his mother.
Have you ever observed the part which
the mother plays in these worn-out men&#8217;s
imaginations? In their books ... in
their love ... she is the emblem for their
morning head-aches, their impotent compunctions.
Her business it is to soothe
their worm-eaten thoughts ... they
whisper her name while they kiss their
lady-loves. I don&#8217;t know which is the
greater insult: that offered to the mother
or to the mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Fru Adelheid tried to rise, but just
then he passed so close to her that she
could not move. So she remained sitting,
weary and racked, and he went round the
room and stopped here and there while he
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;These are the men to whom our wives
belong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And they do not take
them away, so that we can bemoan their
loss and get new wives in their stead.
They are content to nibble the crest of
the tree of love, which we have planted
in our garden, and to leave it to stand
and thrive as best it can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid stood up before him with
moist eyes and quivering lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Cordt&#8217;s face was white with anger
and she could not find a word to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I amuse you, Adelheid?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>She went to her place by the chimney
and sat down again:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8220;You are putting out all my lights,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>He walked across the room and went
on talking:</p>

<p>&#8220;A man&#8217;s honest love goes for nothing,
when one of these gentry has laid eyes on
his wife. Then he is degraded to the
mere husband ... a dull and clumsy
person ... the owner of something which
he cannot own. Then there awakes in
my wife&#8217;s mind a longing for something
which she does not possess. Her peace has
turned into weariness and the love which
her marriage offered into an empty custom.
She resigns herself. And the silly
words of every silly book sing in her
ears. She knows that no love endures
for ever ... that marriage is odious.
Impatient sighs rise up in her soul, embitter
her days and sadden her nights.
Then she changes the gold of love for
small coin and fritters it away, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the lights shine forth and the music
strikes up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He folded his hands about his neck and
stood by her chair and looked before him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid,&#8221; he said ... &#8220;I cannot
understand that the men who occasion
this state of things are allowed to go free
among us. And we honor them as the
most distinguished of mankind. When
we see a poor cripple, a shudder comes
over us ... am I not right, Adelheid?
We are disgusted with a face full of pain.
But these lepers beam before our eyes
with a radiance and a beauty that know
no equal.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked up and down for a while and
time passed and there was silence in the
room.</p>

<p>Then he sat down in his chair, where it
stood by the balcony-door, among the red
flowers.</p>

<p>He was tired and closed his eyes. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and then, he opened them, when a carriage
drove across the square or a cry
sounded. Then he closed them again
and fell into a drowsiness in which everything
was present to him and painful.</p>

<p>And then suddenly he started up.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid was lying before him on
the floor, with her cheek against his knee.
His hand was wet with her tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be angry with me, Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt ... when you speak like that
... it is true ... true for me also....
It is all so good and so beautiful....&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair and rose to
his feet:</p>

<p>&#8220;Be very careful what you do, Adelheid,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I am not a fashionable
preacher, working up your nerves and
quieting them again ... not a poet, reading
his last work to you. I am your husband,
calling you to account.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>He crossed the room and then returned
and stroked her hair:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is beyond our strength, Adelheid,&#8221;
he said, sorrowfully. &#8220;God help us!&#8221;</p>

<p>She took his hand and laid it over her
eyes, so firmly that it hurt her.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the old God were still here, then
we could go down on our knees and fold
our hands together, as they did who built
this room. Would that not be good,
Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I call upon Him, Adelheid.... And
upon everything in the world that is
greater than my own power.... And
upon the little child downstairs....&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fru Adelheid</span> lay on the floor before
her chair and pulled the flowers of her
bouquet to pieces. Cordt sat with his
head leaning on his hand and looked at
the flowers.</p>

<p>&#8220;If only you would speak, Cordt....
If only you would ask me something.
Why don&#8217;t you ask me something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What can I ask you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask me what I am thinking about.
Why I have come home so early. Why
I have not been here for so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know all that, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed her hands on her knee and
swayed to and fro and looked at him with
dark and angry eyes:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&#8220;Is there anything you do not know,
Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so either. You know
the right and the wrong of everything between
heaven and earth. You are never
in doubt and never at a loss. You know
at once what is good and what is bad; and
then you go away and do what is good.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head and said nothing
and she grew still more angry:</p>

<p>&#8220;You alone know. Whoever does not
obey you is lost. There is no room in the
house for any but you and those who
serve you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt bent over her and lifted her up
in the chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be silent for a little, Adelheid,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;And stay quiet for a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she slipped to the floor again and
looked at him defiantly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not sit in that chair,&#8221; she said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&#8220;Never again. I am not worthy of the
honor. You do not know everything,
Cordt. You do not know me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stroked her hair with his two hands
and forced her head back:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then show yourself to me,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She released her head and her eyes grew
moist:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not be good to me,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know me. I am not
the woman you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she laid her head on the chair
and said, softly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so sad, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be glad again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But I shall
always be sad.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took the ruined bouquet and laid
it on the chair and her cheek upon it.
She closed her eyes. Cordt looked at
her&mdash;she seemed so tired&mdash;and they were
long silent. Then she said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>&#8220;It is so cold in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then silence fell upon the room
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sat with her back against
the chair and stared into the fire with
strange eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt ... do you know ... that sometimes,
when I am merriest ... outside
... it is as though I heard little children
crying.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear little children crying, Cordt.
When I am dancing ... and sometimes
when I am singing. And at the theatre
... when there are many lights and people
and I am happy ... then it comes
so often. Then I hear little children crying
... far, far away, but still I can hear
them distinctly ... I can never help
hearing them ... Cordt ... do you know
what it is?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, I know, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adelheid looked at him and turned her
eyes to the fireplace again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes it happens differently,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;When I hear a child crying
... when it is really a child crying ...
a strange child, which has nothing to do
with me, which I know nothing at all
about ... I needn&#8217;t even see it, Cordt
... but then I have to cry myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a little. Then she
turned her face to him and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what that is, Cordt?&#8221;
And he looked at her calmly and said
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she said and shook
her head softly. &#8220;I love our little boy
and love to have him with me. Don&#8217;t I,
Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is much happier with old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Marie. He prefers to be with her. He
puts out his little hands to me when I
come in. But, when I have had him in
my arms for a while, he wants to go back
to Marie. He is so small still.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes he will not kiss me on any
account. He always kisses old Marie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When she comes to die, we will put a
tombstone on her grave,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
on the stone we will write, &#8216;<i>Here lies one
whom the children in the house kissed.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid folded her hands behind
her neck and looked up at the ceiling:</p>

<p>&#8220;At one time, you used to tell me about
your mother ... that is long, long ago,
Cordt. You talked of her so often, in
those days ... why do you never do so
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think only of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved nearer to him and laid her
head on his knee:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&#8220;May I lie like this, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stroked her hair and left his hand
lying on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Cordt looked at her hair and stroked it
again. She closed her eyes and nestled
up against him:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so quiet here,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now
I will go to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>But then she grew restless again. She
half raised herself and lay on her knees,
with her hands folded in her lap. Her
hair had become undone and slipped
down over her shoulders. Her eyes stared
into the fire:</p>

<p>&#8220;You used to tell me that your mother
undressed you every night when you
were a little boy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And every
morning she dressed you ... always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So she did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said that it so often made her
late when she was going to the theatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
... or else she would get up from the
table when there were guests. And
your father used to be so angry with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think your father was right,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I think it was odd of your mother
... not quite ... not quite natural.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt pushed the hair from his forehead,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could see quite well that you would
have me do the same. But I couldn&#8217;t do
it. I can&#8217;t do it as well as old Marie
does and I can&#8217;t see that that is necessary
in order to be a good mother.... Then
you also told me that, one evening, when
your mother had to go out, you cried
without stopping until she came home
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, if your mother had been like me
and if old Marie had undressed you every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
night, then it would have been she whom
you would have cried for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it would,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But it
was good for me and good for herself that
it was mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>But then she raised her head and looked
at him with great, proud eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... I understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
understand that it is good for a man and
gives him confidence to see his wife
chained to her baby&#8217;s cradle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her quietly and sadly and
her defiance was broken then and there:</p>

<p>&#8220;How strangely you say that,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Cordt....&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she laid her head on his knee
again and they were silent for a time.
Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember the evening when I was
going to my first grown-up ball. A lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
came to dress my hair. I was so solemn
and the lady so talkative. She told me
that I was pretty and that I was sure to
be married soon; therefore I must lose
no time and dance as much as I could;
for, once a girl was married, she had to
give up dancing. I asked her what she
meant and said that I knew many married
women who danced. Then she told me
that that was true enough and that there
were many fine ladies who did, but then
they danced their children dead and
therefore it was a great sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved in his chair. She raised her
head and laid it on his knee again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe that we can dance
our children dead, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not reply, but stroked her cheek.
But she pushed his hand away and turned
her face and looked at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe it, Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Then Fru Adelheid rose awkwardly
from the floor and stood before him.
Slowly, she raised her hands and pressed
them against her temples.</p>

<p>Cordt sprang up and took her hands
firmly in his own and drew her to him.
But she tore herself away and her eyes
stared vacantly into his and did not see
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are your children and mine,
Cordt ... the little children who cry
when I am merry ... the children who
died because their mother danced....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid!&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice was very soft and his eyes
very gentle. She stared into them and
saw a gleam in their depths. She understood
that he was rejoicing within himself,
because he thought that he had her
as he wanted her.</p>

<p>He put out his hands to her and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
eyes and his silent, quivering mouth spoke
a thousand loving words to her. She
stood stiff and cold and looked at him
stiffly and coldly.</p>

<p>And, when his hands touched her, she
drew from him and pushed her chair
far back, as if she could not find room
enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not understand me,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>She crossed the room to the balcony-door
and stood there. Then she came
back to the fireplace, where he had sat
down, and looked at him as though he
were a stranger:</p>

<p>&#8220;Those little children who cry,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;what do they cry for?&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his hands and let them fall on
the arms of his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do they cry?&#8221; she repeated.
&#8220;Because they have not been brought
into a world which is closed to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
at the very moment when they see its
beauty?... Because they are not born
to die?&#8221;</p>

<p>She went away again and came back
and sat in her chair with a strained expression
on her face, as though she had
to explain something to one who was slow
of comprehension:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Her voice was harsh. She swung her
body to and fro and her thoughts hunted
for words in which she could say what she
wanted in such a way that it would be
settled once and for all and could not be
misunderstood.</p>

<p>Then her looks fell on Cordt, as he sat
there by her side, shattered and tired,
with closed eyes and nerveless hands.
She saw the pain she was giving him.
She wished to undo and repair it and the
tears broke out in her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>She took his hand and it lay lifeless in
hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then her mood changed about. She
pushed herself back in her chair and
crossed her arms over her breast:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must help myself,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;How could you, either, an old ... yes,
an old man like you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not answer, did not stir, did
not look at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;An old man like you,&#8221; she repeated,
&#8220;who longs for peace and quiet and nothing
else. Then you give out that that
is the best happiness which is the easiest
and the cheapest and the best adapted to
domestic use.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt had raised himself upright in his
chair. His hands lay clenched about his
knee, his eyes blazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you put the woman you love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in your mother&#8217;s chair ... your grandmother&#8217;s
and your great-grandmother&#8217;s
chair....&#8221;</p>

<p>He flew up and stood before her with
his hands on his hips and his lips pressed
close together:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid started and looked at
him with frightened eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to speak to me like
that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>He sat down again and threw his head
back in his chair, with his face turned
away from her. She was so tired, could
not find the words she wanted, said everything
differently and in another tone than
that in which she thought it.</p>

<p>And, as he quieted down beside her,
she began to think more clearly than
usual and it seemed to her that there was
nothing to be done but to say her worst.
Then she clenched her fists, to give herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
strength, and closed her eyes while she
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must know things as they are,
Cordt. It is all true, as you have seen
it and as you have said it. I have lied
to you, Cordt. I lied in my words ... I
lied every time I came up here and sat
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now she looked at him. He raised his
head with an effort and met her eyes.
Then he turned his face away again:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are lying now,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She opened her mouth and closed it
again, so that her teeth struck together.</p>

<p>Then she crossed her hands in her lap
and bent over them and wept:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Cordt stood up and walked across the
floor, slowly and wearily and without
thinking. Fru Adelheid&#8217;s tears fell into
her lap.</p>

<p>They were in this room, each independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of the other, each without sympathy
for the other. Their hearts were dead,
their thoughts paralyzed. They were no
longer two people who loved each other
and who strove to be happy, not even two
who were angry or sorry because they
were to be parted. They were just two
people under sentence of death, whom
chance had imprisoned in the same cell,
but who had nothing else in common.</p>

<p>Cordt was the first to come to his senses.</p>

<p>He was standing behind her chair
and the scent of her hair awakened him.
He bowed deeper over her and remembered
who she was. He looked at her
hands, which were wet with tears, and his
heart wept with her.</p>

<p>Then, at that moment, he saw that he
must spare his sympathy if he wished to
keep her. And, when he saw this, he at
once realized that she was lost to him
for ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>He sat down in his chair and sought
for the words which he should say. He
felt like the actor who has to deliver the
last sentence in the play, while the audience
is already leaving, because the
end of the performance is there and the
tension over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>That was all he could say. She understood
what was passing within him and
was speechless too and wept softly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And the night sped on.</p>

<p>She was lying on the floor again, where
she had lain before, with her cheek upon
his knee. She talked ... hastily, by fits
and starts, without troubling what she
said, as long as she could get it all said.</p>

<p>Cordt leant his head on his hand and
his thick hair fell over his forehead. He
closed his eyes and opened them again,
heard what she said and forgot it again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
answered from time to time and knew only
that it was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are other men for me besides
yourself ... it is true ... it is all true....
Ah, Cordt, may I say it, wicked as it
is?... And you will be kind ... you
understand that it is not that ... that it
is not infidelity....&#8221;</p>

<p>She pressed her hands together and
shook her head in despair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... yes ... it is infidelity, Cordt
... it is.... It is, because it&#8217;s you
... and because I understand it now.
May I tell you, Cordt ... may I?... I
love the desire in their eyes.... I am
curious about it.... There is nothing in
it that insults me.... I am happy in it,
I even try to kindle it....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those things are not said to one&#8217;s husband,
Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom shall I say them, then?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>&#8220;Those things are not said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah ... well ... I say them. I will
say them. Because you are the man you
are. And, also, you asked me about it,
Cordt ... you saw it and wanted to save
me ... that was why you spoke to me
about it, wasn&#8217;t it?... I did not know
what it was ... now I do know.... I
am not lying now ... but I did not know,
before you said it. And it is no uglier
for me ... it is better for me.... Cordt,
Cordt ... it is less ugly so.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands and wept
so that she could not speak:</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is worse still, Cordt ... it is
worse than I have said ... why do you
not turn me out?... Ah, if you were
only dead, Cordt!... Why should you
be so unhappy and why should it be I
that make you so? If you cast me away,
it will be only what I deserve. For I
know that it is you I love.... I know it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
now as I never knew it before ... you
are the man that was destined for me....&#8221;</p>

<p>She seized his clothes with her hands
and half raised herself, so that her white
face was close to his:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt ... can&#8217;t you wait for me?...
I am coming....&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she released her hold and sank
in a heap on the floor:</p>

<p>&#8220;No ... no ... I cannot do what you
wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and stood before
her and looked into the fire:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your will that is sick, Adelheid,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>He walked across the room and stood
at the balcony-door and looked out. Then
he came back and sat in his chair again:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know where the great joy lies.
And you know that it would be yours and
mine, if you could reach it. But you cannot.
There is no sense of perspective in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
your life ... everything to you seems
quite close or quite far, quite small or quite
big. You are like Martens and the others.
You belong to them, because your will is
weak, like theirs. You are becoming like
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are like them. You are a
woman and you are refined and therefore
you dread the mire. But you belong to
them. You and I are mortal enemies.
If you were she whom my son had chosen
for his wife, I should tremble for his happiness.
And you had the happiness which
you seek ... nay, the happiness that exists.
You set the cup to your lips when
you were young enough to stand wine and
old enough to know that it was good.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pushed the hair from his forehead
and looked round the room:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing more to be said.
You are a child of the time and the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
claims you as its own. There was no
sense in bringing you to the old room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are clever and you are refined
and you have seen its great, silent
beauty. And, one day, you will see that
happiness lay in the land where you were
and you sallied forth to find it in distant
climes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see that, one day. But then
it will be too late. Then the years will
be gone. Then the strings of the old
spinet will be rusted and mute and the
spinning-wheel will have fallen to dust
and the fire died out in the chimney.
Then your fancy will be frightened and
bewildered, like the bird that keeps on
flapping against the window-pane. Your
faith will be lost and your modesty turned
to unchastity.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose and went across to the balcony-door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Fru Adelheid lay with her cheek
on the fender and with closed eyes.</p>

<p>A silence hung over the room greater
than it had ever known before. They
both of them felt it and felt it as the
silence when pain is dumbed at the approach
of death. They no longer fought
against the inevitable, against what was
stronger than themselves; and they were
so tired that they no longer thought of
the defeat which they had suffered, but
only smiled in the peace which they had
won.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And the night sped on.</p>

<p>They were sitting again in the quaint
old chairs and looked at the embers that
were expiring in the hearth. The candles
were nearly burnt out.</p>

<p>They were both of them very gentle and
very still. It seemed years since they
had last differed. Their faces were calm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
their eyes clear and sad, when they looked
at each other, but without longing, without
anger or bitterness.</p>

<p>And they looked at each other and
talked together ... of that which was
over.</p>

<p>Their words had lost all sting. He
held her hand in his and pressed it as
that of a good friend. Once, she pushed
his hair from his forehead as she would
have done to a child.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any one saw us sitting here, he
would not understand what has happened
to us,&#8221; said Cordt.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, if anyone had heard every word
that fell between us in this room, he would
perhaps say that we were a pair of simpletons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid shook her head:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well that nothing more has happened
to us,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Cordt.</p>

<p>Then he let go her hand and drew
himself up in his seat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think it would be easier
if there were an action that had to
be forgiven,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Something to
be forgotten. Then it would not be
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not over,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have
missed happiness, because I did not keep
the measure by which I should be gauged.
But our boy down below lives and he
can win a wife who shall sit in the old
room with honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Cordt. &#8220;The secret of the
old room is out. It does not suit these
times and still less the times to come.
Our son shall not see his happiness shattered
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, a little later, he pressed his hand
hard to his temples and said so softly that
she just heard it:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>&#8220;For it is hard to decrease one&#8217;s own
happiness.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The candles went out ... one after
the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is late, Adelheid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
had better go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>But neither of them was able to.</p>

<p>They looked at each other and sat
steeped in the same thoughts, afraid to
end this still night, which was to be followed
by bad days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then the last candle went out.</p>

<p>Cordt&#8217;s lamp still burnt on the table,
but it was as though everything in the
room was displaced in its glow. There
was darkness where light had been before
and great shadows on the wall.</p>

<p>They both felt it as something uncanny
and involuntarily moved closer together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>&#8220;Sing to me, Adelheid,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She went to the spinet and sat down and
looked at the keys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing the last of the Lenore songs.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked over her shoulder, but could
not see the expression on his face.</p>

<p>Then she sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">When death comes, come, Lenore, too:</div>
<div class="indent">Thou wert Life&#8217;s beacon rosy-red;</div>
<div class="verse">And, by those glad, great eyes shot through,</div>
<div class="indent">In that same instant, Death were dead.</div>
<div class="verse">So am I never Death&#8217;s, but thine;</div>
<div class="indent">No tears shed I, nor once complain:</div>
<div class="verse">Set only thy red lips to mine</div>
<div class="indent">And take thy soul again.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I shall have seen for the last time</div>
<div class="indent">The radiant, loving eyes I treasure;</div>
<div class="verse">And what of song and what of crime</div>
<div class="indent">I wrought let others weigh and measure.</div>
<div class="verse">But thou sometimes wilt not forget,</div>
<div class="indent">When evening creeps across the pane,</div>
<div class="verse">The scent of shy blue violet</div>
<div class="indent">That sweetened all the plain.</div>
</div></div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Cordt was standing behind her chair
when the song was finished. She did not
perceive it, but sat with her hands on the
keys and softly repeated the last lines.</p>

<p>He looked at her hair and her hands
and at the white dress that hung over
her shoulders and her lap. He knew as
he had never known before what he had
lost and knew that he would never win it
back. His hands trembled, his eyes
burned. He thought that he must kill
her and himself.</p>

<p>Then he spoke her name.</p>

<p>She looked up and looked at him.</p>

<p>She forgot everything, saw nothing but
him. He could see it in her great, strange
eyes and in her red mouth.</p>

<p>And she sprang up with a cry of happiness
and he took her in his arms and
carried her away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> candles on the mantelpiece were
lighted and their gleam fell through the
balcony-door over the square, as it had
done every evening since the house was
built.</p>

<p>Outside, the square shone with a
thousand lights. There was a sound of
carriages, but at a distance, for the
house was thrust a long way back and
its walls were as thick as the walls of
a castle.</p>

<p>And, when time passed and night came,
the noise died away and you could hear
the rippling of the fountain, which never
begins and never stops, and cries, no one
knowing what they are, solitary steps that
approach and retreat again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Cordt stood by the fireplace of the
empty room.</p>

<p>He stared at the places where the quaint
old things had stood which had seen his
race pass through the room.</p>

<p>He remembered every single piece that
had been brought there and looked at the
empty spot where each had stood. He
closed his eyes and saw everything in its
place again ... the spinet sang ... Fru
Adelheid&#8217;s white train rustled over the
carpet.</p>

<p>He thought of the man who had built
the house and the room and who had
called it the soul of the house and its tradition
and its secret chamber. Of all
those after him who had brought their
wives in here ... of the day when he
himself stood in the room for the first
time.</p>

<p>And he went and opened the secret
recess in the wall which hid the old, yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
document on which each of them who
took possession of the room had written
his name and his wife&#8217;s.</p>

<p>He read the report of the builder of
the house, with its plain, homely phrases.</p>

<p>And, when he had read it and read it
again, he struck out his own name and
Fru Adelheid&#8217;s and went away and left
the door open behind him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII</h3></div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Cordt had finished telling the
story of the old room, he sat by
the window and looked across the square,
where the dusk was gathering about the
newly-lighted lamps.</p>

<p>The servant entered noiselessly and lit
the chandelier and went out noiselessly
again. And the light filled the whole of
the room and fell upon Cordt, who sat and
gazed before him, and upon Finn, who
stood by him with his eyes fixed on his
face.</p>

<p>But Finn and Cordt were not where
the light found them.</p>

<p>They were in the wonderful mystery of
the old room. They heard the rippling
of the fountain outside in the silent square;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
they saw the blaze of the red flowers on
the balcony. The slender notes of the
spinet sounded in their ears; Fru Adelheid&#8217;s
white gown rustled over the floor.</p>

<p>And, when Cordt turned his face towards
his son, he appeared to Finn as a
very big, old man; and Finn seemed to
Cordt the little child that once lay and
laughed in the cradle and fought with its
little fat fists.</p>

<p>Then Cordt stood up and took Finn&#8217;s
arm and they walked to and fro, silent,
overcome with what they had seen and
afraid lest they should shatter the dream
by speaking.</p>

<p>They walked for some time. And,
when, at length, they stopped before the
window, which was dewed with the heat,
so that they could see nothing through
it, Cordt remembered that there was still
something which Finn ought to know and
which he could not ask about.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>He looked at Finn and remembered
how he had loved his mother.</p>

<p>It was her eyes, but more restful-looking;
her mouth, but paler and tired,
as though it had tried a thousand times
to say something which it never could.
He had her slender waist and he was
taller than Cordt, but carried his height
like a burden. Then he also had Fru
Adelheid&#8217;s pale cheeks and forehead,
but Cordt&#8217;s hair, only thicker still and
blacker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finn,&#8221; said Cordt and laid his hands
on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Finn started and could not look at him.
But Cordt took him under the chin and
lifted his head and looked with a sad smile
into his frightened eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one thing left to tell you,
Finn.... Fru Adelheid did not take a
lover.&#8221;</p>

<p>His smile widened when he saw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
son&#8217;s sudden and great joy; and he drew
him to him and kissed him.</p>

<p>But then he suddenly left him and sat
down somewhere in the room, with his
back to him. Finn followed him and
stood by him for a while and thought
kindly and fondly of him and could find
nothing to say.</p>

<p>The thoughts rushed through Cordt&#8217;s
head.</p>

<p>Now that he had lived through it all
anew, the scab broke which the silence
of many years had placed upon the wound
in his will. His eyes grew hard and
angry, he wanted to speak as he used to
speak when he fought his hopeless fight
for Fru Adelheid.</p>

<p>But then his glance fell upon Finn.</p>

<p>He sat as he liked best to sit, with bent
head and his hands open upon his knees.</p>

<p>And Cordt grew gentle again and said,
softly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&#8220;You are glad, of course. For, you
see, she is your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the room and came back
and stood with his arm over the back of
the chair and looked at Finn, who was
lost in his thoughts. It was silent in the
room and silent outside, for it was Sunday.
They could hear the bells ringing
for evening service.</p>

<p>&#8220;She never secured the red flowers in
the place of the blue which she valued so
little,&#8221; said Cordt, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know ... I
often thought....&#8221;</p>

<p>The bells rang out.</p>

<p>There was one that was quite close and
one that was farther away, but louder,
nevertheless. And there was a sound of
distant bells which could not be distinguished
from one another, but which
sang in the air.</p>

<p>It sounded louder than it was, because
they were thinking of it; and the ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
grew and filled the room with its deafening
clamor.</p>

<p>Then there came a rumbling in the
gateway. The carriage drove out in the
soft snow, where they could not hear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Fru Adelheid going to church,&#8221;
said Cordt.</p>

<p>He sat down by his son and began to
talk in a low voice and without looking
at him.</p>

<p>The bells rang and then suddenly
stopped and increased the silence a
hundredfold.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a night at Landeck when
the bells caught her, a night following
upon a day of sunshine and merriment
and many people. She was the gayest of
us all and, in the evening, all at once, she
became silent and tired, as so often happened,
without any cause that I knew of....
You were with us. You were ten
years old then; you lay and slept. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
had been standing together by your bed
and looking at you and she began to cry
and I could do nothing but hold her hand
in mine and stop speaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn listened, as he had just listened
to the bells, without making out what the
words had to tell him. He only knew
that his mother was without blame and
that his father had been able to tell it him
all on that day and to leave it to him to
pronounce judgment between himself and
her. His joy at this sang within him and
made all the rest easy and light and indifferent.</p>

<p>And Cordt continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I went out on the verandah with
my cigar and she stood in the doorway
and listened to the bell of a little chapel
up in the mountains, where we had been
during the day. We had heard the story
when we were there. Once, in the old
days, a pious man had built the chapel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
expiation of a sin and, since then, the bell
had rung two hours after midnight every
day.... She asked whether it would go
on ringing till the end of the world and
we came to talk of all the bells that ring
over the earth, by day and by night, sun
up and sun down, and comfort weary mortals....
Sometimes she was silent. But
the bell rang up there constantly. And
she constantly began to talk again and
constantly about the same thing. About
the bells that sounded so eternally and
so identically over the whole world ...
about those who heard them for the first
time, one day when they were running
like wild heathens in the endless wood
... about those whose will suddenly
broke in the midst of the modern crowd,
so that they fell on their knees and
crept away where the bells summoned
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn looked up. The words now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
caught his mind and he woke from his
dreams.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see her before me still, as she stood
on the night when she carried her soul to
God. Her strange eyes lifted to the stars
... her white face ... her hands ...
and her words, which came so quickly, as
though her life depended upon their coming,
and so heavily, as though every one
of them caused her pain. She never gave
it a thought that I was there: she spoke
as though she were doing public penance
in the church-porch.... And then she
declared that it was over.... It had
become empty around her and cold and
dark to anguish and despair, there where
her glad eyes had beamed upon the lights
and the crowd of the feast. Despair had
come long since and slowly and she had
closed her eyes to it and denied it. It
had grown and come nearer to her and
she had run away from it, as though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
were running for her life. Now it was
there and reached from earth to heaven,
in her, around her, far and wide. And,
if the bells could not conquer it, then she
must die.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt spoke so softly that Finn could
hardly catch his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the bell up there ceased. Soon
after, the day dawned and the sun shone
on her white, moist cheeks. She was still
now and silent, but her thoughts were the
same. When things began to stir around
us, in the town and at the hotel, she went
out, I did not know where, but I daresay
she was at the chapel. Towards evening,
she returned and, at midnight, we sat on
the verandah again and listened to the
church-bell.... A week passed thus. I
often feared for her reason. She always
talked of the same thing and it was almost
worse when she was silent. I sent
old Hans home with you and, the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
day, we left. But it was long before we
reached home. She wanted to travel by
the same road which we had taken on
the journey out. She said she wanted
to pray in every church which she had
passed on her hunt for happiness through
the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn half raised himself in his chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did as she wished. It became a
pilgrimage to every region where life lies
nakedest in its pleasure. Restlessly we
travelled from place to place. She omitted
none, afraid lest there should remain
a single sin which she had not prayed
away, a single memory which the bells
had not rung into the grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then did you come home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt looked at his son as if he had forgotten
that he was in the room. He suddenly
awoke to the consciousness of what
lay between those days and these; and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
face became so gloomy and his eyes so
serious that Finn was frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we came home. And then....&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose quickly and stood with his arms
crossed on his breast and looked at Finn:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we came home. And the years
passed and Fru Adelheid recovered her
peace of mind. She found herself again
and became the same as in the old days.
Her thoughts waver restlessly, her desires
yearn insatiably. Her carriage now rattles
through the streets as before ... only
it stops at the church instead of the
theatre.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn wanted to speak, but could not,
because Cordt stood in front of him and
looked at him fixedly and nodded to him,
once, as if to say that he knew what it
was and that it was no use.</p>

<p>&#8220;She goes to Heaven&#8217;s table,&#8221; said
Cordt, &#8220;and Heaven comes to her parties.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Finn sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>He was surprised and ashamed that he
was not grieved with his father for saying
that, nor with his mother, if it were
true. He knew that he ought to rouse
himself to protest or sympathy, but could
not, because he understood it all so
well.</p>

<p>But Cordt crossed the room with a firm
stride:</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaven is not what Fru Adelheid
thinks, nor where she seeks it,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Perhaps you will not understand me until
you have lived longer in the world;
but look here, Finn ... what I have seen
of God in my life I have seen most in
those who denied Him. In their sense of
responsibility, in their humanity ... in
their pride I have seen God&#8217;s splendor.
The others, those who confess His name
and fill His house ... they masked Him
from me so closely, when they ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
glorify Him, made Him so small, when
they praised His might....&#8221;</p>

<p>He talked about this for a time. Finn
sat dumb and helpless in his chair and
wished his father would cease. He felt
like one who has inadvertently witnessed
something he ought not to see, or like one
who is receiving a confidence under a false
pretence.</p>

<p>And deep down within him lay a little
ironical astonishment at the fire and authority
with which his father was talking.</p>

<p>But, at that moment, Cordt sat down
in front of him with both his hands in his
own and sad and gentle eyes and words as
soft and humble as though he were a sinner
begging for peace:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Finn. I cannot really tell
you anything about it. I can never talk
with you about these things. A father is
a poor creature, Finn, and I am a poor
father. I cannot tell you that the forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
is green and that the birds sing and that
there is nothing behind the blue sky. I
dare not, Finn. I do not think I have
the right to. I cannot go to church with
you, either ... nor even be glad when
you go with your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pressed Finn&#8217;s hands nervously.
They lay dead in his and Finn did not
know what to do with his eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I must talk to you a little ...
just this once ... to-day, when I have confessed
to you and made up your parents&#8217;
accounts. If you will try to understand
me ... and to forgive me ... to forgive
us, because we are not so rich as our child
could expect ... since we have a child....
You love the bells, Finn. When
they ring, you fall a-dreaming; they ring
you far away from where you are. You
were like that ever since you were a little
boy. And I can well understand it. I love
them, too. I am glad because they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
there. But ... Finn ... Finn, there are
so many bells in the world besides those
which summon us to church. Every man
has his own, which are his and his only
... which he alone can hear, which call
no one but him. There are men, opulent,
charming men, for whom the bells ring
wherever they set foot. They lead more
powerful lives than we and prouder lives.
They suffer us ... those of us who love
them. But there is not in the world a
man so small but that the bells call him.
One has them in his work, Finn. And
one in his child ... and one in his love.
For one they hang in a neat little room
where his mother lives and where he
can only come for an hour, perhaps ...
on a Sunday.... It is not the same for
the one as for the other, Finn, but the
bells are there always. They call their
man back when he has strayed from the
way he should go, or, if that is too late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
they ring for his remorse. They ring to
the banquet and they ring their music
when he is tired and sad.... But the
church-bells ... they ring for the man
whose ears life has deafened ... and life
makes such a terrible noise. They ring
on Sundays to remind us of that which we
have forgotten throughout the week....
And it is well that they are there.... But
... Finn ... it is so tragic when the
church-bells drive and tumble people together
who once had each his own sacred
church. It is just as when a home breaks
up and the old find a refuge in the workhouse.
The sun shines through the windows
and it is warm indoors and there are
flowers in the casement. But there was
once something that was better.... For
your mother and me, Finn ... for us the
bells used to ring in the old room.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent and no longer looked at
Finn. And Finn was at ease again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
at last found words for what he had long
wanted to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;May I use the old room, father? May
I set it up again ... all as it was ... and
live there with my books?...&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt released his son&#8217;s hands and his
face wore a look that made Finn regret his
request. They both rose to their feet.
And, at that moment, Cordt&#8217;s face lit up
with a smile:</p>

<p>&#8220;That you may,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You dear
child, who never asked for anything.
Let this, then, be my present to you to-day.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This happened on the day when Cordt&#8217;s
son completed his twenty-first year.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Finn</span> stood in the old room with the
yellow document in his hand:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;God brought me thus far, that I was
able to erect this fair house, which shall
stand till distant times, a witness to my
might and that of my race. Here shall
be upright living and generous dealing;
the house shall be faithfully guarded
from father to son; good men and women
shall sit in the hall and dance to the sound
of flutes and violins.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have placed this room in the most
secret part of the house and no one knows
of it but the architect who built it and
my oldest servant. But I have sealed the
architect&#8217;s tongue with a solemn oath and
a heavy fee; and my servant is true to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>&#8220;I have decorated the room with gilt
and figured leather hangings and costly
carpets from the East. I have had two
great armchairs made in Milan, whose
woodwork is carved into birds and animals
which grin strangely in the dark, but
cease to do so when the lights are lit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I gave my servant a key of the
room and told him to care for it faithfully.
Every evening, when it grows dusk, he is
to light the candles on the mantelpiece;
and he is to do this even if he know that
his master is travelling in distant lands.
Every morning, he is to adjust the room
with his own hands. None but himself
is ever to cross the threshold.</p>

<p>&#8220;For this room shall be for me and my
wife and for none other in the world.
Therefore I placed it in the most secluded
part of the house, far from the counting-house,
where we work, from the passages,
along which our servants go, and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the drawing-room, where we receive our
guests, ay, even from our marriage-bed,
where she sleeps by my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be the temple of our marriage,
hallowed by our love, which is greater than
anything that we know. Here we will
pray to Him Who gave us to each other.
Here we will talk gladly and earnestly,
every evening when our hearts impel us
to. And, when we come to die, our son
shall bring his wife here and they shall
do as we did.</p>

<p>&#8220;This evening, which is the first in my
new house, I brought my wife in here and
told her my wish. She listened to my
words in love and gladness and I have
written down in this document how it all
happened and we have set our names to
it in witness for those who come after us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Finn read their names and the names
of those who had taken possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
room after the builder and his wife. Last
of all stood Cordt&#8217;s name and Fru Adelheid&#8217;s,
which were struck out again.</p>

<p>Then he put the document back in its
place and locked it up and looked round
the room.</p>

<p>The old room stood again as it used to
stand, built high over the square, long
and deep and silent, like a spot where
there is no life.</p>

<p>The balcony was white with snow and
the sparrows hopped in the snow. Inside,
behind the colored panes, stood
many red flowers and longed for the sun.
The dust had been removed from the
figured-leather hangings, which shone
with a new brightness. The oriental
carpet spread over the floor like a lord
returning from exile and once more taking
possession of his estates.</p>

<p>And all the old glories had found their
places again and stood as lawfully and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
restfully as though it had never been otherwise.
The spinet was there and the jar
with the man writhing through thorns
and the celestial globe whose stars shone
and ran: all the furniture which the
room&#8217;s different owners had set there in
the course of time, each after his own
taste and heart.</p>

<p>Before the fireplace stood the two great,
strange armchairs.</p>

<p>Finn felt as if he were in a cathedral
where every flag was a tombstone over
a famous man. His senses drank the
odor of the bygone times, his fancy peopled
the room with the men and women
who had sat there and exchanged strong
and gentle words, while the house lay
sleeping around them.</p>

<p>With it all, he became lost in thought
of those who had sat there last and after
whom no others were to come, those
two who had given him the life which he
knew not what to do with.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>He saw them before him in the love
and struggle of their youth. He heard
their voices in the room, he saw Fru
Adelheid&#8217;s red mouth and Cordt&#8217;s steady
eyes. He saw Cordt bring his wife into
the room, which was the soul of the house
and its tradition and its secret chamber,
and show her the strange things which
his ancestors had put there.</p>

<p>He saw him on the day when he stood
alone by the fireplace ... in the empty
room ... and struck out his own name
and Fru Adelheid&#8217;s from the document
and went away and left the door open behind
him....</p>

<p>He saw all this as it had happened. But
they were not his father and mother. They
were two attractive people of whom he had
read in a book and grown fond, as a man
loves art, palely and with no self-seeking
in his desire.</p>

<p>Finn drew one of the big chairs over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to the window and sat down and sat there
for long.</p>

<p>He was sitting there when Fru Adelheid
came.</p>

<p>She stood in the doorway, in her white
gown, with her white hair, and nodded
to him. Then she turned her face round
to the room and looked at it.</p>

<p>And then that happened which was
only the shadow of a dream that vanished
then and there: everything came to life
in the room.</p>

<p>The spinet sang, the queer faces on the
old chairs raised themselves on their long
necks; there was a whispering and a
muttering in every corner....</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid shrank back against the
door. She did not see Finn, did not remember
that he was there.</p>

<p>But Finn saw her.</p>

<p>He rose from his chair and his eyes
beamed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>&#8220;You light up the room, mother,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and the room lights up you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand and kissed it and,
with her hand in his, Fru Adelheid went
through the old room, which had been
too narrow for her youthful desires.</p>

<p>The fairy-tale was over and the dread.
But the glow still lay over her figure and
made her look wonderfully pretty. Her
cheeks were as pink as a girl&#8217;s; her step
was light, her eyes moist and shy.
She laughed softly and gladly, while she
looked at the old things and talked about
them and touched them.</p>

<p>She told the story of the woman who
used to sing when she was sad and who
had brought the old spinet there; and
her hands shook as she struck a chord
and the slender, beautiful notes sounded
through the room. Of the spinning-wheel,
which had whirred merrily every
evening for many a good year and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
stood as it was, with thread upon the
spindle. Of the celestial globe, which had
been the toy of the man whose intellect
was obscured. Of the doll with the
vacant face, which stood there in memory
of the lady who dreaded the deep silence
of the room and never entered it but once;
but her son, who loved her, had hidden
the doll in the curtain. Of Fru Lykke,
whose portrait had hung where the light
stain was, but hung there no longer, because
her marriage had been dissolved.</p>

<p>Of the jar with the man writhing
through thorns, which she herself had
brought as her gift, she said nothing. She
passed her hand over its bright surface
and was silent.</p>

<p>Finn&#8217;s eyes clung to her.</p>

<p>Never had he seen his beautiful mother
so beautiful. He did not know that look,
or that smile on her mouth, or that clear
ring in her voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>At times, he added something to what
she was telling and spoke with such profound
intelligence that she was quite surprised
and frightened. Now he guessed
her words before she uttered them. Then
he knew something which she had never
suspected.</p>

<p>Secretly, her fear increased as to what
Cordt could have told him.</p>

<p>But Finn was lost in his delight.</p>

<p>And, fascinated by her beauty and the
strange things he had seen and heard and
the deep silence of the room, he forgot that
the seal of the old room was broken and
wished to play the game as vividly as
possible.</p>

<p>He drew the second of the two big
chairs across to the window and made her
sit down and sat himself beside her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you are not my mother,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You are my young bride. I have
brought you into the sanctuary to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and now I will initiate you into the
mysteries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid turned very pale and Finn
took her hand penitently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I hurt you, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head and forced herself
to smile.</p>

<p>Then he walked into the room again
and rejoiced at all this and talked about
it. But she remained sitting with knitted
brow.</p>

<p>She was heavy at heart, because it
seemed to her, all at once, that she was
not his mother, as they sat talking here in
the secret chamber of the house. The
old days came in their great might; and
their strong memories and impressive
words drowned the bells which had rung
her into another world.</p>

<p>It was the echo here, in the old room,
of Cordt&#8217;s words and of his love ... of
the strong faith and great happiness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the race which had sprouted in the good
mould of tradition and produced flower
after flower in the times that passed.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid thought&mdash;for a moment&mdash;that
it would have been well had things
happened as Cordt wished.</p>

<p>But, at the same instant, she was seized
by a thought that suddenly made her rebellious
and young, as when she was here
last, many years ago.</p>

<p>She thrust her chair back hard and
looked with sparkling eyes round the
room where everything and every memory
was hostile to her.</p>

<p>She looked at Finn, who was standing
by the celestial globe and trying to set it
going, but could not, because the spring
was rusty and refused to work.</p>

<p>She wondered, when the time came for
Finn to take a wife ... would he try to revive
the tradition and bring her here and
sit down with her in the old chairs?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>Then Finn&#8217;s son and his son after him
would read her name, which was written
on the yellow document and struck out
again. She would be like one of those
who were branded in that family....
Legends would grow about her love of
going out and her hunt after happiness
which did not exist....</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and help me, mother,&#8221; said
Finn.</p>

<p>She went over and pressed hard on the
spring and the clockwork hummed.</p>

<p>&#8220;See how you let loose the magic,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>He went on talking, delighted with the
stars, which lit up and ran.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down here by me, Finn.&#8221;</p>

<p>She waited till he came and a little
longer, as though she could not find the
words she wanted, and did not look at
him while she spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Finn&#8221; she said and put her hand on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
shoulder and drew it away again immediately.
&#8220;Finn ... once ... ever so many
years ago, I was alone, one evening, in
the old room. I had often been here before,
you know ... with father. And I
was under the power of the old room and
never happy. I was young, Finn, and
it went so terribly hard with my longing
and my gladness. I could not understand
that and could not mitigate it or
get over it. For father belonged to the
room and it was his and all the queer
things in it and they were all against me.
Every time I came to the door, my heart
stopped beating.... And once I was inside ...
it was ... it was as if my own
words were taken from my tongue and
others put in their place for me to speak
... beautiful words and good words,
Finn, but not mine. But then, when I
took courage and said what I wanted to
say, it sounded as if I was defying the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
room and father and God himself. And
then....&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid felt that she was on the
point of betraying something great and
fine that had been laid in her hands.
She looked round as if she were afraid
that there was some one in the room or
that the room itself would rise up against
her in its venerable might.</p>

<p>But there was no one and it was silent.</p>

<p>Then she turned her face to Finn and
looked at him and said, gaily:</p>

<p>&#8220;But that evening, Finn, I broke the
spell of the old room. I tore the veil from
the Holy of Holies and saw that there was
nothing behind it. For the first time, I
breathed freely in my own home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid did not tell how, at the
same moment, she had been overcome by
terror and fled from the room. But she did
not gain what she thought by her lie. For
Finn looked at her sorrowfully and said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8220;How could you do that, mother?
How could you find it in your heart?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you also under the spell?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>There was in her tone a scorn which
was stronger than she intended and which
frightened herself. But Finn simply paid
no attention to it:</p>

<p>&#8220;The old room no longer exists,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It is nothing more than an image,
a monument ... my fancy, which father
humored me in.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her face away and listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;But had I lived in the days of the old
room,&#8221; he said, &#8220;then it would certainly
have captured me and held me captive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... you have been talking to
father,&#8221; she said, softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he lay down before her, with his
cheek on her hand, as he so often did:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;And ... mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
... I love you. You are so pretty. But
we will not talk about the old room ...
ever. For I think it is the most wonderful
... and the most beautiful and the
strongest thing I know of.... But it
hurts me that I am not wholly your son
... or father&#8217;s either, that I might devote
myself to one of you in sharing
your strongest feelings. And I cannot
talk to father about it ... neither can we
two, can we?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid did not answer him, but
stroked his hair with her hand. Neither
of them spoke and it was quite silent in
the room.</p>

<p>In the silence she became herself again.
The many moulded years came to their
own again and the bells rang monotonously
and ever more strongly from out of
the noise of the world, which had drowned
them.</p>

<p>She marvelled at the excitement into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
which the old room had thrown her.
Quenched was the love which had made
her its mistress and quenched the red
desire which made it too narrow. She
thought of Cordt, who had fought, she
considered, for what was not worth fighting
for. Sorrowfully she looked at her
tall, silent boy, whose weary thoughts kept
pace so well with her own.</p>

<p>She crossed her hands in her lap and the
light faded in her eyes. The glow of the
old room withdrew from her face, her
words became restful as her thoughts.</p>

<p>Finn looked at her, but did not see this.
For him, too, the fairy-tale was over. He
was sitting in his chair again with bent
head and his hands open on his knees.</p>

<p>And, without their doing anything or
thinking of it, they came in their usual
way to talk together. It was not any
interchange of thoughts and still less a
contest of opinions. They said nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the same thing and, wherever the thoughts
of the one roamed, he found the other&#8217;s.
Often their words were solemn, but never
powerful. Often the one was silent and
agreed with the other. Many times they sat
long without saying anything and thought
they had told each other everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Finn, pointing out of the
window. &#8220;How hideous!&#8221;</p>

<p>A hearse came trotting across the
square.</p>

<p>He moved in his chair and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;A hearse should always drive at a
foot&#8217;s pace, solemnly and ceremoniously
... always ... as though they were only
driving the horses to water. And soldiers
should always hold themselves stiff and
starched, keeping step and time, even
when they are taking their shoes to the
cobbler&#8217;s. Then it would all be easier.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a while. Then he
slowly turned his face to her:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>&#8220;I was talking about it to father the
other day,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I happened to say
something of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it came about. But
he laughed and said I ought to write an
article about it or form a society for preserving
the correct pace of hearses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid smiled and laid her hands
in her lap and looked at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he suddenly became serious and
came up to me and laid his hands on my
shoulders: &#8216;Hearses ought to drive fast,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;gallop ... at a rousing pace.
Away with the dead, Finn! Let life grow
green and blossom!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father is so masterful,&#8221; said Fru
Adelheid.</p>

<p>Finn nodded.</p>

<p>Then they began to talk about Cordt.
They often did so. And they were always
eager to find good words to praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
him in. But under the words there lay
the consciousness, like a secret understanding
between them, that he was made
of a coarser clay than they.</p>

<p>They never said this; but they felt a sort
of patronizing pity for him, such as one
feels for a person who runs and runs, when
it is good to sit still.</p>

<p>But, when they talked together, Fru
Adelheid knew that deep in Finn&#8217;s soul
there lay a secret yearning towards just
that masterful side in his father which
frightened him.</p>

<p>It was so weak, only a pale reflection
of her own young love, a distant echo of
the voice which had stated Cordt&#8217;s case
in her own heart when he was fighting
to win her.</p>

<p>But it was enough to hurt her. She
thought she only had her son for a time.
She traced a certain disdain in the intimacy
to which he admitted her. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
thought there was something in him which
was greater than what he gave her and
which was Cordt&#8217;s or would become so.</p>

<p>And she realized that the fight for Finn
would become harder than that which
broke the seal on the door of the old room.</p>

<p>Finn was absorbed in what had filled
his mind, the whole day, with light and
color. He was thinking now of his
mother&#8217;s visit to the room on the evening
when she had broken the spell:</p>

<p>&#8220;I simply cannot understand how you
could have the heart,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She knew at once what he meant, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;There ought to be some law, like that
in the fairy-story, where he who lifted the
veil had to die,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And there
ought to be veils upon veils ... veils upon
veils.... Can you bear to look at the sun,
mother? Women ought to go in a veil
and never ... never raise it, except when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the occasion was so great that everything
grew great.... And one ought not
to see the people who play....&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid half raised herself in her
chair.</p>

<p>She wanted to tell him that, on that
evening, she was punished for her presumption
with the greatest terror which
she had ever experienced in her life.
But she could not. Then she said, quite
quietly and with her eyes looking out over
the square:</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose there were some one who
could not ... suppose the veil stifled
one....&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn looked out into space like her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Veils upon veils.... Veils over the
dead,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sighed and said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then one could live,&#8221; said Finn.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> that day onward, Finn only left
the old room when obliged.</p>

<p>The spring had opened the fountain
before the house and he was happy at its
rippling, which never began and never
stopped. The red flowers were put out on
the balcony: when the wind blew, their
petals fluttered right over into the basin
of the fountain and rocked upon the water.
He followed their dance through the air
and wondered if they would reach their
goal.</p>

<p>His best time was in the evening, when
the square shone with a thousand lights.</p>

<p>He loved the dying day.</p>

<p>He knew every light that went out,
every sound as it stopped. And he liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the sound best when it stopped and the
light when it went out. He thought that
the people who moved down below, disguised
in the darkness, were of another
kind or better than those whom the sun
shone upon. He had no more to do with
them than with the others; but he liked
them better.</p>

<p>Then, when night came and the rippling
of the fountain sang louder and
louder through the silence and cries
sounded from down below, no one knowing
what they were, and solitary steps
were heard, that approached and retreated
again, then he lit the candles on the mantelpiece
and sat down in one of the old
chairs, there where the owners of the
house and their wives had sat when the
house slept and they had something to
say to each other.</p>

<p>He looked round the room, where the
things sang in every dark corner, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
simply could not conceive that he had not
known the old room before.</p>

<p>He was more at home here than anywhere
else: here, where he was outside
the world, which worried him, because it
demanded that of him which he had not;
here, where every spot and every object
told how all had been said and done
and accomplished in the old days, so
that he had nothing else to do but listen
wonderingly and rejoice at its marvellous
beauty.</p>

<p>Then he fell a-dreaming and remained
sitting till the lights went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not sleep enough,&#8221; said Fru
Adelheid, anxiously.</p>

<p>Cordt crossed the floor with the same
thought in his mind. Then he stopped
where she was sitting and looked at
her:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder, is he ever awake, Adelheid?&#8221;
he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>By day, Finn generally sat at the window
and stared out, idly and silently,
with his hands open on his knees.</p>

<p>Often, when Cordt was crossing the
square, he thought that he could see
Finn&#8217;s old face behind the window-panes.
He would stop and nod and beckon to
him.</p>

<p>But Finn never saw him. For he saw
nothing positively.</p>

<p>And Cordt went on ... in and out ...
constantly longing to see the strong air
of the old room color his son&#8217;s cheeks
and rouse his will ... constantly trusting
that, sooner or later, this would happen.</p>

<p>He never went up there since the day
when he and his old servant had arranged
the room as it used to be.</p>

<p>And Finn was glad of this. He was so
afraid lest that should happen that a long
time passed before he could suppress his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
terror when he heard any one coming.
And, even when he had recovered his
composure, he knew that it would happen
sooner or later and that the day of its
happening would be a gloomy one.</p>

<p>For he well understood the eternal
loving question in Cordt&#8217;s eyes and it
hurt him and frightened him. He dreaded
the craving in his affection, which was
greater than a father&#8217;s. It was like that
of a sovereign for the heir who is to occupy
the throne after him.</p>

<p>And Finn could not take the reins of
empire in his slack hands or bear the
pressure of the crown upon his head,
which ached at the mere thought of it.</p>

<p>But Fru Adelheid often came; and they
two were comfortable up there, in the old
room.</p>

<p>She came with no craving; and, if she
was doubtful and restless, as she often
was since Finn had moved up into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
old room, then she would be quite silent
when the door closed behind her.</p>

<p>Silent like Finn ... and like the big
chairs and the jar with the man writhing
through thorns ... silent like the spinning-wheel,
which had whirred merrily
every evening for many a good year and
stood as it was with thread upon its
spindle.</p>

<p>He looked at her and smiled and nodded
when she spoke. He himself talked ...
for long at a time and then stopped, without
its making any difference, and listened
to the rippling of the fountain and the
voices in the old room, which always
talked to him and plainest when Fru
Adelheid was with him.</p>

<p>He told her that, when she came, the
room was no longer his own.</p>

<p>For then he felt like a stranger, a man
of another period, who should suddenly
find himself in an old ruined castle, full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of marvellous dangers and adventures,
and stand face to face with the last of
those who had lived the castle&#8217;s rich,
wonderful life.</p>

<p>Once he spoke her name aloud just
as she was entering at the door. It was
dark in the room and his voice and figure
were so like Cordt&#8217;s that she grew pale
and frightened. But he did not see this
and she forced a laugh and soon forgot it.</p>

<p>And, gradually, the wonderful solemnity
of the old room retreated into the
background, when they were both there,
for they spent more and more of their
time there and at last simply did not
think they were together except there.
But Finn was always able to summon
it up when he wished.</p>

<p>They used to read together.</p>

<p>And that happened in this way, that
one of them found a book, a treasure
of silence and singing, which was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
only sort that they felt equal to, and
read it and gave it to the other, who
then read it while they were together.</p>

<p>They found most of the books in foreign
languages and it seemed as if there were
no end of them. Also, the fact that the
language was foreign made the book
dearer to them, because it carried them
farther afield.</p>

<p>When they had read one of these books,
they lived in it for a time ... not in its
action, among its characters, for there
was no action and no characters, but in
its music. They tuned their thoughts
and words in its key.</p>

<p>Then they felt as if they had passed
through some experience or as if they
were travelling.</p>

<p>&#8220;The artist lives,&#8221; said Finn. &#8220;He
makes the sky blue and grey for himself
... for himself and for us all. He wipes
everything out with his hand and builds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
it up again ... greater, ever greater.
He is the master. He is God.&#8221;</p>

<p>One day, he asked Fru Adelheid to sing.</p>

<p>She had not sung for many years, except
in church, and was surprised at his
request:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have given up singing, Finn.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lay down before her and looked up
smiling into her face:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can remember so well when you
used to sing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You often sang
to me when I was a boy. But one occasion
... one occasion I remember in
particular. There were many visitors and
I, of course, had long been in bed, but
I was not asleep. For old Marie had
promised to take me down to the dining-room
when the people had got up from
dinner and you were to sing. She told
me that, when there was company and
all the candles were lighted and you were
prettiest and brightest, then you sang a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
thousand times more beautifully than
usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took her eyes from his face and
laid her head back in her chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kept awake till she came and it
lasted long. But then I heard you and
also saw you for a moment through the
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And was it so nice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I
remember the many faces.... I should
know them again if I saw them now, I
think. And best of all I remember
father&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid rose:</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I sing?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He laughed with content, went to the
spinet and opened it. Then he took up
one of the pieces of music:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look what I have found,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;This was sung by the one who put the
spinet here. Look, here is her name: she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
herself wrote both the words and the
music.... See how pale the writing is
... and how distinct.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid stood with the old, yellow
sheet in her hand. She hummed the
tune and struck the keys.</p>

<p>Then she sat down to the spinet and
sang:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>She remained sitting a while with the old
music-sheet in her hand. Then Finn said:</p>

<p>&#8220;She used to sing that. Do you know
if she was happy, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was often sad,&#8221; said Fru Adelheid.
&#8220;And, when she was sad, she sang.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put down the sheet and took up
the first music-book that came to hand,
but threw it aside, as though it had burnt
her fingers.</p>

<p>It was the Lenore songs, which she
had sung to Cordt.</p>

<p>She rose and went back to her place
beside Finn. Then she sprang up and
stood with her arms crossed on her breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and sat down again and stared with great
eyes through the window:</p>

<p>&#8220;Finn ... if I sang it to you ...
would you recognize the ... the song
you heard when Marie carried you
down...?&#8221;</p>

<p>He woke from his dream and looked at
her in surprise:</p>

<p>&#8220;The song ... no ... I should not.
Why, do you remember it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Fru Adelheid.</p>

<p>They long sat silent. Twilight fell and
it grew dark in the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Finn, &#8220;what are women
like?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned her face slowly towards him.
He did not look at her. His eyes were
far away and she realized that he had
forgotten his question or did not know
that he had put it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fru Adelheid</span> stood in her wraps at
the window and looked out. The horses
were stamping in the porch below; the
footman stood by the carriage-door and
waited.</p>

<p>They were going to the station to fetch
Finn.</p>

<p>He had been abroad the whole summer.</p>

<p>This was the first time he had been
away alone and he had not enjoyed
himself abroad. From Florence, Spain
and Paris he had written to ask if he
might not come home. But Cordt was
resolved that he should remain abroad
for the time agreed upon.</p>

<p>He wrote oftenest to Fru Adelheid ...
and stupidly and awkwardly, because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
knew that his father would read the letters.
Cordt noticed this, but said nothing. He
hurried through the letters as though he
were looking for something positive and
put them down with a face as though he
had not found it.</p>

<p>He always gave Fru Adelheid the letters
he received, although she never asked for
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fru Adelheid looked impatiently at her
watch. She sat down, closed her eyes
and pressed her forehead against the pane.</p>

<p>She thought how empty the house had
been during the summer.</p>

<p>Cordt had not said a word about the
old room, but, from the day when Finn
had moved up there, things had altered
between him and her. Something had
happened ... something indefinite and
nameless, but none the less fateful on that
account.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>And, while Finn was abroad, this had
grown between them ... without their
doing anything to further or prevent it.
Neither of them thought about it. Both
led their own lives and drifted farther
apart in their yearning for their quiet
child. The day was long for them, their
rooms were cold.</p>

<p>But inside her was a growing anxiety for
Cordt, who became ever more silent and
wore such a melancholy look in his eyes.</p>

<p>A door opened and she sprang up:</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be late, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; he said, calmly. &#8220;You
ordered the carriage too early.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us go, Cordt. We may just as
well wait there as here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt sat down with his hat on his knee
and looked at her. She stood with bent
head and buttoned her gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down for a moment,&#8221; he said and
pushed a chair towards her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>&#8220;Do you want to talk to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, Adelheid,&#8221; he said, impatiently.
&#8220;Sit down for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid leant against the chair
and remained standing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is long since we talked together,
Adelheid ... many, many years. Do you
know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; she said and made her
voice as firm as she could. &#8220;We have
peace now, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt nodded. He drummed with his
fingers on his hat and looked out of the
window:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... yes, no doubt. We are old,
Adelheid. As old as can be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that what you wanted to say to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid for Finn,&#8221; said Cordt.
&#8220;He will come home as pale as when he
went away, a poor dreamer by the grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of God. To-morrow, he will be sitting
up there and staring out at the life he
dare not live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... why should he be up in the
old room?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was he who asked me,&#8221; said Cordt,
calmly. &#8220;I could not deny him his inheritance.
He has the right to know the
ground he sprang from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what then? Do you think you
can bring the dead days to life again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that.
I don&#8217;t want that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a little. She did not
take her eyes from his face. Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Finn can build himself a new house,
if he likes. Or he can refurnish his ancestral
halls. And put in plate-glass
windows and wide staircases and anything
that suits him and his period. But
he must know and be thankful that the
walls are strong and the towers tall.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>Fru Adelheid pushed back the chair she
was leaning against:</p>

<p>&#8220;There does not appear to be room for
a mother in your arrangement,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Her voice trembled, her eyes were large
and angry. But Cordt rose and looked
as calm as before:</p>

<p>&#8220;You went out of it, Adelheid. You
did not wish to be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply. She understood
that he did not mean to consult her, to
ask her for her help ... did not even
want it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid ... now that Finn is coming....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?...&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid for him, Adelheid. And
I would ask you to be on your guard and
do him no harm. I believe that sometimes
you smother his poor, dejected
spirit. The peace which you have gained
may be good in itself and good for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
... but he is young, you must remember.
He is only at the start of life, he has no
need for peace and resignation. What
is a boon to you is death to him,
perhaps....&#8221;</p>

<p>She took a step forward and raised her
face close up to his:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it has come to this, Cordt, that
you think I am your enemy for Finn&#8217;s
sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may become so,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will drive me to it, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand and held it tight when
she tried to draw it away:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No, Adelheid. I
only want to warn you.&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> balcony-door was standing open,
because they had forgotten to close it.
But the weather was mild and there
was hardly any wind. Now and again,
a yellow leaf fell somewhere or other
from the baluster. It began to grow
dusk.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sat with her head in her
hands and stared out before her.</p>

<p>Cordt&#8217;s words kept ringing in her
ears. She did not think either that
Finn was as he used to be. He was
restless, could not sit still, talked more
than usual:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wherever I went, I found the fountain
outside,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It followed me
throughout my journey. There was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a rushing noise so strong but the fountain
sounded through it nor a night so
still but it came rippling and sang me
home again to the old room.... I
wonder, did one of the owners of this
house set it up?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Finn. &#8220;That must be it.
I am sure of it. Perhaps it was the one
who built the house. You see, it forms
part and parcel of the old room ... it
sums it all up. If there was nothing else
but the fountain, it would all be here just
the same. I must ask father.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shivered with cold and Finn shut
the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are chilly people,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Both
of us. We are not like father. He
laughed at me yesterday when I came
down to his room to say good-morning
and wanted to shut the window. &#8216;Don&#8217;t,
Finn,&#8217; he said. &#8216;The autumn air is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
bracing and healthy, it makes one young
again ... sit in the draught and don&#8217;t
be afraid, old man that you are!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father is strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn looked at her stealthily.</p>

<p>He had soon understood that his parents
had drifted apart while he was abroad;
and he suffered in consequence. He was
as kind and affectionate to his mother as
ever; but his thoughts were always harking
back to Cordt, whatever they might
be talking of:</p>

<p>&#8220;Father is so sad,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t noticed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She colored after saying this. But
Finn was not looking at her, scarcely
heard her reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was strange, mother ... out there,
on my journey, ever so many times I had
a feeling that I came upon father. Wherever
I went, I would suddenly hear his
voice ... then he would be close to me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I walked with him, regulated my step by
his and talked to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid his head back in his chair and
closed his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Often it was as if he had been where
I came and prepared everything for me,
so that I saw him in every corner. Sometimes
I felt that I must put off my departure
until he came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did he come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always. Wasn&#8217;t that strange?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid thought the sound of his
voice was different from ordinary. He
did not look at her, as he was used
to do ... his thoughts were not with
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where were you and father to-day?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We went out into the woods ... a
long way out. Father was silent, but not
so bored as at home. It was so lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
out there ... and so strange. One could
hardly see a thing ... for the leaves falling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Fru Adelheid.</p>

<p>Then she bent over him to look into
his face, which had grown thinner and
paler during the time that he was away:</p>

<p>&#8220;Finn,&#8221; she said, &#8220;was I not with you
... out there ... when you were travelling?&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn smiled and nodded his head:</p>

<p>&#8220;You came in your letters,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That father never did. But you were
mostly here at home, where I was longing
to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought it was strange that he did
not take her hand when he said that.</p>

<p>And, suddenly, she became conscious
that she was sitting in terror lest he should
slip away from her.</p>

<p>What had she to hold him with, if anything
seized him that was stronger than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
their quiet life in these hours ... what
had she, if he went...?</p>

<p>It seemed to her as though Cordt stood
in the room and beckoned him out into
the yellow woods, where the air was so
bracing and good. And Finn leapt up
with a joyful cry ... they went away ...
and never looked back....</p>

<p>She felt that Cordt was stronger than
she and hated him for it. She sought for
a weapon to defend herself. She wished
that Finn, who loved her, would lie down
before her, as he so often used to do, with
his cheek against her hand. And she
knew that he was not thinking of it.</p>

<p>She felt so wretched and so lonely that
she grew frightened and called upon her
old longing for the red happiness ... if
only it would come and take her, so that
she might have something to set against
him who had everything....</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing to me, mother,&#8221; said Finn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She crossed the room with a stronger
step than usual. Her cheek was red and
her eyes glowed. She took hold of the
instrument with firm hands when she
opened it. Finn noticed this and looked
at her in surprise; but it was not light
enough for him to make out her face.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid remained sitting with
bowed head.</p>

<p>The song had broken her pride. She
trembled over all her body and great tears
fell upon her hands. She had conjured
up spirits which she could not lay; she felt
more powerless and small than she had
ever felt before.</p>

<p>She began to think of Finn and looked
round in alarm. But he could not see
her and she wept silently. She laid her
forehead against the spinet ... then her
hand fell upon the keyboard and she
started and rose from her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a strange song,&#8221; said Finn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>It was so still in the room that she could
not bear it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not sung it for many years,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;In the old days, I used to sing
it often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was father like when you met
him?&#8221; asked Finn.</p>

<p>She stood with her back to him and
turned the pages of the music with trembling
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was he as handsome as now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... no.... I don&#8217;t know if he
was handsome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was ... he was charming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he was ... that he was,&#8221; he
said and clapped his hands like a child
who is delighted with a story. &#8220;And
then he was so masterful ... was he not?...
So that one was bound to follow
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Fru Adelheid.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>&#8220;Father was a king,&#8221; said Finn.</p>

<p>Her heart throbbed, she listened with
all her senses. She felt that Finn was
somewhere close to her and accomplishing
something that would destroy her.
And she could not turn round, could not
go to him and beg him to desist.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could wish I had a brother,&#8221; said
Finn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you feel lonely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No ... no, it is not that. But then
he should have the kingdom.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> that time, Finn made a friend whom
he had not chosen or wanted for himself,
but whom Cordt gave him in his anxiety,
because he thought he could never get any
one better.</p>

<p>His name was Hans and they had
known each other since they were children.
He was a year older than Finn, not quite so
tall, but more powerfully developed, with
bright hair and eyes and disposition.</p>

<p>His father was a little man who sat
among the people in the counting-house,
where his father had sat before him.
He and his little wife had no luck in life
save their son. But at times they trembled
for his future, because his ideas were
so pronounced and took so wide a range.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>For, even as he was taller than his
father, so he would not be content with
his measure in anything.</p>

<p>Above all, he did not want to sit in the
office, but to go out in the world, big as
it was. And, from the time when he
was a little boy, he believed that it was
bigger than they told him.</p>

<p>Now that he had grown up and become
conscious of his need and his powers
and could not get anywhere, he went fearlessly
to the master of the house and told
him how the matter stood.</p>

<p>Cordt liked him and wanted to keep
him for his house, but soon saw that he
had nothing that could tempt him. He
asked him what he would like to be; and
it appeared that Hans wanted to be an
engineer.</p>

<p>Cordt looked at him and thought that
his glance could blast rocks.</p>

<p>Then he promised his assistance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
remained sitting in deep thought, while
Hans went down the stairs singing.</p>

<p>Time passed. He advanced along his
road and both he and the others could
see that he was fully keeping pace with
his dreams. Cordt did not lose sight of
him and was pleased when he called. But
Fru Adelheid did not like him, because
he talked so loud and had such a heavy
tread.</p>

<p>One evening, Cordt stood in Hans&#8217;
room and talked to him as he had never
talked to any one:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your father&#8217;s employer,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and my father was your grandfather&#8217;s.
My son will never be yours.
For you mean to make your own way and
be your own master. You would have
done that even if no one had lent you a
helping hand. That is true. But then
you would have become bitter, perhaps,
and distrustful and narrow-minded in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
use of your strength. From this I delivered
you. To-day, I come to ask for
a return.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hans had taken the hand which he put
out to him and stood ill at ease, without
understanding. And Cordt sat down
wearily and sat long without speaking
further.</p>

<p>At last, he woke from his thoughts and
looked at the young man, who could not
interpret his glance, but was moved by it:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish that you were my son,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I have a son and he is a good
lad and I love him. He has not your
strength of character, but then he does
not need it. His path was smoothed and
shaded from the day when he was born
and grew up. But he can give you many
things which you have not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened to his own words, to the
way in which they kept on shaping themselves
into an apology for Finn, a prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
for forbearance towards him. He suffered
at this; and Hans, who saw his distress,
felt, without understanding, that something
important and tragic was taking
place in this great house, where he and
his had earned their living.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you try if you can be his friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hans was quite willing.</p>

<p>Cordt looked at him and gauged his
strength. He looked round in the little
low-ceilinged room which contained nothing
but what served Hans in his work.
He looked out of the window, where the
roofs intersected one another, dirty and
grey against the sky: smoke rose from
hundreds of chimneys, the noise of the
courtyard and the street filled the room,
the window was broken and pasted up
with paper.</p>

<p>Then he again turned his eyes to the
man who sat amidst these mean surroundings
and grew up strong. And Cordt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
knew that he was not standing here as his
benefactor and his father&#8217;s employer, who
was opening his rich house to him. He
stood here as one who could beg and
nothing more.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you used to play together as
children,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And, when he had said that, he was
overcome with emotion, because he remembered
that Finn had never played.
Hans thought the same thing, but could
not find the words that should be spoken
on this occasion and the silence became
heavy and painful to both of them.</p>

<p>To say something at all costs, Hans
asked if Finn was ill.</p>

<p>Then Cordt understood that Hans must
long since have pronounced his judgment
on the pale, silent heir of the house and
that the judgment could not be good.</p>

<p>He rose, tired of seeking for guarded
phrases. He laid his hands on Hans&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
shoulders and looked at him in such a
way that Hans never forgot it:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you be David,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come
to us with your harp. And come of your
own accord and come when we send for
you.&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first thing was that Finn had his
former room arranged so that he and
Hans could be there when Hans came to
see him.</p>

<p>There was nothing said about it. For
it was taken as a matter of course that no
stranger should set foot in the old room.
But Cordt at once thought that his hope
in Hans was shattered.</p>

<p>Sometimes Finn was glad when Hans
was there.</p>

<p>They could never talk together.</p>

<p>Hans&#8217; thoughts were constantly at
work on plans and difficulties, the least
of which seemed quite unsurmountable
to Finn, and he had not the remotest idea
as to what passed in his friend&#8217;s brain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
He talked to all men alike and his words
were all questions or answers or opinions.</p>

<p>So it was Hans who spoke and, wholly
taken up with himself as he was, he seldom
noticed that Finn fell a-dreaming.</p>

<p>When Finn could get him to set to
work on some calculation or other, he
himself sat delighted and watched Hans
while he struggled with figures and drawings.</p>

<p>He was amused at Hans&#8217; wrinkled forehead,
his eager, impatient movements.
And he waited expectantly, like one sitting
on a race-ground, or wherever else
men are engaged in contest, for the shout
with which the engineer would fling aside
the pencil when the problem was solved.</p>

<p>Then Finn&#8217;s face beamed with delight.
He was as pleased as if it had been himself
that had gained the triumph and he
had no notion what sort of triumph it was
or what it was worth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>But sometimes, and more and more frequently,
Hans was too active, too restless
for him.</p>

<p>There were days on which Finn hid
when his friend called. Often, Hans&#8217;
mere presence in the room occasioned him
real bodily pain. He could feel half unconscious
under his powerful glance, his
voice, which was so loud and jolly, his
words, which all meant something.</p>

<p>Then he sat tortured and wretched, because
it was not possible for him to ask
the other to go. And it was only seldom
that Hans perceived this. When it did
happen, there was no end to his awkward
distress; and then Finn was not content
before he had succeeded in persuading
him that he was quite wrong.</p>

<p>Then Finn submitted, in the same
way in which a hopeless invalid submits to
a new cure which prepares new sufferings
for him and in which he does not himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
believe. And, while he suffered, he
thought incessantly of his father, who
suffered more than he did and whom he
could not help.</p>

<p>His best time was when they were out
together.</p>

<p>They drove and rode; and then they
were never agreed, for Finn wanted to
ride slowly and drive fast and Hans
wanted just the opposite. They were
always eager to accommodate themselves
to each other, but this came to pass only
when it was Finn&#8217;s wish that prevailed.</p>

<p>Finn did not like going out. But, once
he had started, he was glad; and then he
always wanted to have Hans with him.
He was shy in a crowd and his friend&#8217;s
presence reassured him.</p>

<p>They generally walked in the streets,
for Finn felt cold if he went outside the
town. Then he took Hans&#8217; arm and
kept step with him and was proud of him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
He liked to hear his strong voice through
the noise of the street, his quick step, the
tap of his stick on the pavement.</p>

<p>Then Finn would sometimes begin to
talk.</p>

<p>Mostly of his travels. And he could
speak of these almost as he thought and
as he spoke to his mother. It was as
though the life and the noise that half
drowned his words made him feel freer
and safer.</p>

<p>And, although Hans cared but little
for what Finn had seen and talked about,
still there was a color and a gleam about
his words that captivated him.</p>

<p>But, when it happened that the noise
in the street was suddenly stilled, then
Finn was silent and frightened. And, if,
for a moment, they were separated in
the crowd and Hans failed to catch a sentence
and asked him to repeat it, or seized
upon some phrase and asked for a further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
explanation and confirmation, then
Finn was forthwith tired and his mood
changed.</p>

<p>He often stopped when a piece of street-life
caught his attention. He pointed it
out to his friend and made it the subject
of his talk. Then Hans would underline
his words with some racy observation or
other, which amused Finn, but afterwards
annoyed him, because it spoilt the
picture for him.</p>

<p>They never talked about women.</p>

<p>Finn was silent, because his thoughts
were vague and modest. And Hans&#8217; experiences
were not of such a nature that
he cared to talk about them. Then, also,
they both had an instinctive feeling that
they had less in common on this subject
than on any other and that they did not
wish ever to cross each other&#8217;s path.</p>

<p>On one occasion only was Finn his
friend&#8217;s guest in his home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>It was a regular feast in the little rooms,
high up under the roof, and Finn was
glad to be there.</p>

<p>He looked in delight at the two little
old people who stood and sat with folded
hands and little bows and nods and did
not know how to show their respect and
gratitude to the young master of the
house. They took it for granted, as a
settled thing, that Finn must be vexed
because Hans had broken with tradition
and gone his own way and they made
endless covert excuses for it.</p>

<p>And through the excuses rang their
pride in the strong son whom they
handled as cautiously as though he would
fall to pieces if they took firm hold of
him ... their joyous dread of the greatness
that awaited him.</p>

<p>Finn understood them and was touched
by them. He sang his friend&#8217;s praises
and prophesied a preposterous success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
for him and was happy to read the gladness
in the little parents&#8217; eyes.</p>

<p>And, while he was deep in conversation
with them and amused at Hans, who was
utterly confused that his friend should
see the adoration of which he was the
object, the picture of his own parents
suddenly rose before his thoughts like
great black silhouettes against the light
background.</p>

<p>He stopped talking and then they all
became silent and it was not pleasant in
the room.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he stood with Hans and
looked through the open window.</p>

<p>His eyes roamed over the hundreds of
roofs. The sun shone on the slates and
the red tiles and lit up the telephone-wires.
Little garret-windows stuck out on
every side ... with chintz curtains, with
wall-flowers and geraniums and pelargoniums
and yellow birds in white cages.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>In one place there hung an elegantly-painted
wooden box with ferns, which
were quite brown, but stood proud and
stiff, and a little fir-tree in the middle.
In another, the curtain fluttered right out
into the air and waved and flapped like
a flag. Here, two sparrows hopped about
in the gutter ... there, a caged bird was
singing, shrilly and sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How charming this is!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Hans did not exactly think so.</p>

<p>But, at that moment, Finn set eyes on
a window a little to one side and so near
that he felt as if he could reach across to it.</p>

<p>The window was open. There were
flowers in it and there was a bird which
hopped from perch to perch in its cage,
silently and unceasingly. Behind the
flowers sat a young girl sewing. He could
see the back of her and a bit of her chin
and hear the stitching of the sewing-machine:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>&#8220;Look,&#8221; he said, in an undertone.</p>

<p>Hans came up and at once looked away
again:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Marie,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s a
seamstress.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was nothing wrong either in the
words or in the tone in which they were
uttered. But he said it so loud and so
carelessly that it hurt Finn. The girl
opposite looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>Then something like a cloud passed
over the whole picture, with the flowers
and the bird and the sunny roofs. Finn
sighed and came away from the window.</p>

<p>And, when they sat together at supper
and had finished eating, suddenly
there fell upon him an insuppressible
melancholy.</p>

<p>He looked from one to the other and
read in their faces that they were subduing
their gladness on his account. He
imagined what it was like when the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
were alone, busy and cheerful in their
work and in their faith in one another.</p>

<p>And behind their kind words and smiles
he felt the pity for their quiet guest. But
he thought of this only as pity for Cordt
and of himself as one who suffered blame.</p>

<p>Then he hurriedly took his leave.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Hans</span> and Finn were driving in the
woods, when a little stray dog ran under
the wheel and was badly hurt.</p>

<p>They both jumped out of the carriage.
Hans knelt on the ground and took the
gasping dog in his arms:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me your pocket-handkerchief,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Not receiving it at once, he looked up,
impatiently.</p>

<p>Finn did not stir.</p>

<p>He stood leaning over the dog and
looking into its glazed eyes with a great,
deep, strange glance. He was not thinking
whether it was an animal or a human being,
whether it could be saved or whether
he himself could do anything....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>&#8220;Finn!&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not stir. He was staring into
the great face of death. The door of the
dark house was flung open and he stared
and stared into the darkness. His soul
was filled with a devout awe. He felt
nothing, saw nothing, but life expiring
before his eyes.</p>

<p>Hans looked at him speechlessly, terrified
at the expression in his face, which
he did not know how to interpret, and
grew more and more agitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me your pocket-handkerchief,
Finn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn started. He looked up and handed
him the handkerchief:</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Hans did not reply. In a little while,
the dog was dead and he flung it in among
the trees in such a way that Finn could
have struck him.</p>

<p>They got into the carriage and drove on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
in silence. Finn thought of nothing but
what he had seen and did not suspect
his friend&#8217;s agitation. Then, suddenly, he
told the coachman to pull up:</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t mind, Hans,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I am going to get out.... I can go
home by myself.... I want to be alone
for a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hans jumped out of the carriage and
walked away without saying good-bye.
Finn took no notice. He let the coachman
shut the door, shrank into a corner
and drove home.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid came to him in the old
room and could not make him speak of
what lay on his mind. She smiled to
him and took his hand and sang for
him.</p>

<p>But Finn sat silent and absent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some time after, the friends were walking,
one evening, through the streets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
along the canal, where the boats lay in a
row and, on the other side, an old castle
stood, with broken windows and charming
green roofs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us sit here for a bit,&#8221; said
Finn.</p>

<p>They sat on the quay. The water
flowed black and angry beneath them.
The boats rocked and bumped and
swayed. Hans drummed with his cane
against the embankment-wall:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it like this in Venice?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Finn. &#8220;It&#8217;s finer there.
Because one&#8217;s strange to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hans laughed gaily and Finn said
nothing more and looked down into the
water.</p>

<p>Then they suddenly heard a shout.</p>

<p>They both sprang up and ran and,
when they had come some distance, they
saw a child on the point of drowning:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Finn ... help me....&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>Hans scrambled down into one of the
boats and was fumbling with the oars.
But Finn ran on and jumped into the
water, where the child was, without a
moment&#8217;s reflection.</p>

<p>He could not swim and Hans had first
to save him. Then, with the greatest
difficulty, he rescued the child. They
went home to Cordt&#8217;s house and, when
the first fright was over and it became
clear that Finn had suffered no harm,
they all sat in the living-room and talked
about it.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid held Finn&#8217;s hand between
her own and patted it and pressed it.
Cordt walked up and down in great
emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you take it into your
head?&#8221; said Hans. &#8220;You know you
can&#8217;t swim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never gave it a thought,&#8221; said Finn,
quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>Cordt stopped in front of his son and
nodded to him. Fru Adelheid kissed
him on the forehead and her eyes beamed.</p>

<p>Hans looked at them, crimson with
anger.</p>

<p>He thought of how Finn might have
been drowned, or the child, or both of
them. Then he remembered the scene
in the woods, with the dying dog. He
could not understand these people&#8217;s train
of thought and he despised it. He
looked at none of them and, with an
effort, forced his voice to be calm, as he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;One has no right to behave like that.
It is stupid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Finn.</p>

<p>But Cordt put his hand on the engineer&#8217;s
shoulder and looked at him
in such a way that Hans suddenly remembered
his own little faint-hearted
father:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Cordt, &#8220;it is stupid that
Finn shouldn&#8217;t know how to swim.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then it was decided that Cordt&#8217;s son
should learn to swim.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Fru Adelheid</span> sat, book in hand, without
reading.</p>

<p>It was late. Finn had been with her
and had said good-night and Cordt was
not at home. It was silent in the house
and silent outside.</p>

<p>She had a feeling as though she were
alone in the world.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid was not happy.</p>

<p>The peace which the good grey years
had brought had departed from the
house. She could not see her way anywhere:
not with Finn, not when she was
alone, least of all when Cordt was in the
room.</p>

<p>She did not feel safe even at church.
It would happen to her that she left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
church heavier in mind than when she
entered. It also happened that she simply
dared not go in, but turned back, when
the organ pealed to her in the porch.</p>

<p>She sat and stared, with her white
hands folded in her lap. She wanted to
try if she could think the thing out to
the end. But she had tried before, with
ever-decreasing success.</p>

<p>First, there was the going back to the
old room.</p>

<p>This was the beginning and she could
not but think that it was the whole
matter, for, in truth, she had never got
over it. She could not defend herself
against the memories that came crowding
one upon the other. Her blood grew
hot, her eyes moist, without her knowing
why.</p>

<p>She suffered from a constant terror
which she could neither explain nor
shake off. Now it was Finn, whose pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
face frightened her. Now it was Cordt,
who was silent and ever more silent and
brooded over his thoughts.</p>

<p>Then she was overcome as by a despairing
remorse and she could not see
how she had offended. Then she went
in a secret dread of revenge and she knew
of no one who meant her any harm.</p>

<p>There were days on which every step
she took gave a dull and threatening
echo of the old days. She felt as though
she were living in a house whose walls
were full of secret recesses with old documents
which would upset everything that
existed, if they came to light ... she felt
as though she were walking over mysterious
vaults that concealed the traces of
mysterious crimes.</p>

<p>Wearily, Fru Adelheid leant her head
upon her hand and let her hand fall again.
She half rose in her chair and hid her face
in the roses that stood on the table before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
her. She took up the book and put it
down at once.</p>

<p>Then Cordt came.</p>

<p>He nodded to her, went to the farther
side of the room and sat down with a
book.</p>

<p>She looked at him timidly. She heard
him turn the pages and wondered what
book it was. She asked him. He answered,
without looking up, and the
silence increased twofold.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sighed and rose to go to
bed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He closed the book and tossed it on
the table. She stopped and looked at
him. Then he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Hans been here to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down in her chair again. He
had got up and was pacing the room.
She waited and listened to his footsteps.</p>

<p>Then she could bear it no longer:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>&#8220;Cordt!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt ... Finn will die, if Hans is
always with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, softly and sorrowfully.
&#8220;Finn will die and you will die and I shall
die. But Hans will live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do with him,
Cordt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten what I want?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her and his eyes hurt her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if your wish is also mine,
Cordt,&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said that calmly, without anger, but
also without hesitation.</p>

<p>Then she leapt up:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your wish was never mine ... never!
You have been able to persuade me and
frighten me and force me.... I never
meant it, Cordt, never ... even when I
agreed.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>&#8220;Let the dead days be, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now ... Cordt.... Now I am
farther away from you ... now you understand
me less than ever ... there is
something in me now that is a thousand
times stronger than what parted us then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt looked at her with a tempest in
his strong eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;So there is in me, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood before her, drawn up to his
full height. She thought he seemed taller
than usual and his face looked strangely
young.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is Finn,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sat in her chair, because
she could not stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak as if he were your son and
not mine,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>She did not take her eyes from his face.
She could not get rid of the thought that
he looked so young. His hair had not a
sign of grey, his walk was easy and erect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
as in the old days, his eyes glowed with
the same strength and the same confidence.</p>

<p>She bent forward and stared and
sought. Surely she must be able to find
the wounds which sorrow had given him,
the marks which age had brought.</p>

<p>Cordt did not look at her. He stood
with his hands folded about his neck and
with strangely distant eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have said it, Adelheid ... it is
as you say ... there is something now
that is a thousand times greater than what
parted us then. We mortals always think,
when misfortunes come, that no more
will come now ... that it must be over
now. And so there is no difference between
the child with its lost doll and
the man with his dead love ... none
except time, which comes and goes, comes
and goes, puts out a light and kindles
a pyre and puts out the pyre also.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>He dropped his arms and stood silent
for a while:</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid....&#8221;</p>

<p>He said no more. He looked round
the room and at her, as though he were
waking from his thoughts. Then he went
to the window and looked across the
square, where the lights were being put
out.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid stared with great fixed
eyes at where he stood.</p>

<p>She had not seen him during many
years ... where had she been all those
years ... what had she been doing?</p>

<p>Then she had seen him again, distantly
and dimly at first, like the memory
of a fight, a pain, on the day when she
stood once more in the old room. He
had come closer ... the time he warned
her about Finn. And, little by little, he
had approached her through Finn ...
through his fears and his love, through his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
every word, constantly closer and more
effectively.</p>

<p>She clutched the arms of the chair so
firmly that her knuckles turned white.</p>

<p>Now it had come ... now the doors
of the mysterious cellars grated on their
rusty hinges and the crime stood revealed
... now the secret recesses in the walls
were opened and the old documents bore
witness to the right....</p>

<p>Now there was no longer anything between
her and him and there was nothing
outside him and her. He stood beside her
... she could reach him with her hands.
She had no son and no God. His words
swept over her like a storm, his eyes were
bent upon her....</p>

<p>She wanted to get up and run away,
but could not. A sort of dizziness came
over her and the ground retreated under
her feet.</p>

<p>There were voices which told her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
it was surely a very old and forgotten
story ... a legend preserved in the archives
of the house for the entertainment
and instruction of future times, which
would possibly judge differently from the
one who had set the legend down.</p>

<p>There were others, mocking and exultant
voices, which whispered to her that
it was all imagination and nothing else
... that Finn belonged to her and not to
him, that all his confidence and all his
strength would break like glass against
that pale, quiet boy, who loved his mother.</p>

<p>There were hymns and psalms and
organ-pealing and impressive words about
sin and forgiveness and Christ&#8217;s heavenly
glory. The cool air of the church-vault
passed over her burning forehead ... all
the bells rang, as though for a soul in
need.</p>

<p>She heard it all and it vanished like a
sound in the air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>And all the voices were merged before
her confused thoughts.</p>

<p>It turned into an evening in the old
days ... an evening of lights and gayety.
She saw the people of that time ... she
heard her own voice....</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, it was quenched in the
great silence of the old room.</p>

<p>The candles were burning on the
mantelpiece.... She sat and stared into
the red hearth. Now Cordt spoke ...
Cordt in the old days:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will stake life and happiness to win
you. I will talk to you and importune
you and conquer you. I will take you
in my arms and close my door to
you and run after you and forgive you.
And, if I do not win you, I shall cast
you off.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sprang up and clasped her head in
her two hands:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt ... Cordt....&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>He turned round and looked into her
white face.</p>

<p>She raised her face to him and sought
and stared after her portrait in his eyes
... only a thought from the old days ...
a memory....</p>

<p>It was not there. For him there was
nothing in the world except that which
was his happiness and his fear and his
struggle ... now as in the old days....</p>

<p>And it was no longer she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid ... are you ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No ... no....&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed aloud. Cordt took her
hands and led her to a chair. She let him
do as he would and continued to look up
in his face.</p>

<p>Then she suddenly thrust him from her.</p>

<p>She smiled and shook her head at her
folly. She rose and walked round the
room. She said she was quite well, told
him to go away ... just to go away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>And Cordt went.</p>

<p>She stared at the door, which closed
after him, as though she had seen him
for the last time. Then she turned round
and looked into a mirror which showed
her whole figure.</p>

<p>Slowly she walked up to the mirror, sat
down before it, with her head in her
hands, and stared into her own face.</p>

<p>The clock struck one and two from
the church-steeples and she did not hear.
Then some one shouted down in the
square. She rose, took a candle and left
the room.</p>

<p>She went through the long passages and
up the stairs, softly and carefully, as if
she were a thief. She listened at Cordt&#8217;s
door and at Finn&#8217;s. Then she stood
outside the old room. She listened ...
there was no sound. She opened the
door ajar and saw that it was dark.</p>

<p>She went in quickly and walked straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
up to the secret recess in the wall. She
opened it and took the yellow document
in her trembling hands.</p>

<p>Then she stared at Cordt&#8217;s name and
her own, which were written down last
and struck out again.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Finn</span> stood at the window in Cordt&#8217;s
room, with his head leaning against the
frame, and looked down into the yard,
where the porter&#8217;s children were playing.</p>

<p>He had come, as usual, to say good-morning
and Cordt had told him to wait
while he finished a letter. The letter had
been sealed for some time, but Finn had
not noticed it. He was watching the
game down below and bending forward
to see better.</p>

<p>Then the children were called in. He
laid his head against the window-frame
again and looked up at the grey sky. He
thought of Hans, who had left for Paris
that morning and was to remain abroad
for two years.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>Cordt sat silent. From where he was,
he could see Finn&#8217;s profile: the forehead,
which was so white, the eyelids, which
lifted themselves so heavily, the mouth,
which was so tired and so weak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finn!&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn started and turned round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see Hans off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn sat down by the window where he
stood, with bent head and his hands upon
his knees. He wound the cord of the blind
round his fingers and unwound it again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if you will miss Hans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh ... yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall,&#8221; said Cordt. &#8220;Hans represents
the new order at its finest ... the
hero in modern poetry ... the engineer,
you know, whom they can never put on
the stage without making him insipid
... because he never acts a part. He
is strong and has the courage to employ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
his powers. To us he often seems lacking
in refinement and he finds it difficult
to grant us our due. He has no ancestors
... he is the ancestor ... he founds
a dynasty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Finn.</p>

<p>They sat silent for a while.</p>

<p>There was no doubt in Cordt. He
knew what he wanted and wanted it. He
did not seek for kind words, but strong
words. Finn knew this too. He sat like
a culprit awaiting sentence and was
thankful for every minute that passed.</p>

<p>Then they looked up into each other&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>They measured each other&#8217;s strength.
And Finn was strong in his hopelessness,
even as Cordt was strong in the hope
which he could not let go, because he had
nothing else to fall back upon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that you are a born
artist, Finn?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>Finn smiled sadly and shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are,&#8221; said Cordt. &#8220;There is no
doubt about it. When you were travelling
abroad ... there was simply nothing
in your letters but delight at the
pictures you saw. Your journey was
one long progress through a royal gallery.
At sea, in the street, on the mountains
... everywhere you caught life and hung
it on your wall and sat down to look at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you not been born with a silver
spoon in your mouth, you would have been
lost beyond redeeming. You would have
become a painter ... no ... an author.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would that be so bad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What use is literature to us modern
people?&#8221; said Cordt. &#8220;Where does it
lead us? How does it form our lives? If
the old poets had lived nowadays, they
would certainly have been merchants, or
electricians, or arctic navigators.... Just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
look round you, Finn ... the books we
read, the pictures we look at, the plays
they perform: isn&#8217;t it all like an orchestra
that plays for an hour while people walk
about the grounds? Tired people, who
like to hear a bit of music before they go
to bed. The band plays its tune and gets
its pay and its applause and we are interested
in seeing that the performance is
well and properly given.... But ... the
<i>poet</i>, Finn.... A solitary horn sounds
over the hills. We drop the plough and
listen and look up, because the notes seem
to us so rare and so powerful and we have
never heard them before and know them
so well. Then our eyes glisten. And the
sorrow that bent our back and the gladness
that held us erect and the hope we
had ... all of that suddenly acquires
color and light. And we go whither the
horn calls us ... over the hills ... to
new green fields where it is better living.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>&#8220;Father....&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn raised his head, but then could
not find the phrase for what he wanted to
say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that the poet must
be a <i>man</i> ... a man like the others, with
courage in his breast and a sword at his
thigh? Then he goes forth and sings
them to battle and wedding, to dance and
death. He is a part of the business, foremost
in the crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The poets also sat in the ladies&#8217;
chambers and sang,&#8221; said Finn.</p>

<p>Cordt nodded:</p>

<p>&#8220;They did that <i>also</i>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But
the poets we now have do nothing else.
There will always be fiddlers as long as
there are idle women and women with
two husbands and wars and kings. As
long as the stars wander so far through the
sky and the children cannot catch the
bird that flies in the bush.... But never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
mind that, Finn. Never mind that. Just
look at those who sit in the orchestra to-day....
Would you sit among them?
They are sick people singing about their
sickness. One is sick with love and one
with lewdness and one with drink. One
chants his faith on vellum, another sells
his doubts in sixpenny editions. The
feeble will of the one quavers in silly
verses ... the other intoxicates his pale
fancy with blood and horrors drawn from
the olden times. Do you think that a
free man would of his own accord select
his place among those artists?&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn looked up with his quiet eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is a free man, father?... Are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt put his hands on Finn&#8217;s shoulders
and bent over him and looked at him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are, Finn.... You are a free
man ... if you wish to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father....&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>Finn put out his hands like a child asking
for something. But Cordt looked at
him inexorably. And so strong and radiant
was his glance, that Finn tried to escape
it, but could not; tried to speak, but
was silent.</p>

<p>Then Cordt walked across the room, up
and down, with great, calm strides, and
spoke and was silent and never for a moment
released his son from his stern grasp.</p>

<p>His words seized Finn and lifted him
up where things were great and beautiful
and bitterly cold, he thought; then let
him fall again, till he relapsed into his own
dark corner; and seized him anew and
carried him aloft.</p>

<p>But, when Cordt ceased, it was to Finn
as though he heard a flourish of trumpets
from the clouds proclaiming that other
words were now coming, greater still and
austerer, more loving, ever heavier to bear.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are right, Finn.... I am not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
free man, I never was. I am bound up
in the tradition that built my house and
bore my race and, when I could not support
the tradition, things broke for me.
But that did not make me free.... Those
were heavy days, Finn. I could not understand
it, you see, and I fought to the end.
I was young and strong and I was in love.
You are fond of the old room ... you
can hear the legends up there singing
their powerful, melancholy song.... Remember,
Finn, I am one of those on whom
the legend is laid. I have lived in the
secrecy of the old room.... I have stood,
in my calm, proud right ... up there,
where the room stood, unseen by any one
except the master of the house and his
wife ... always remote and locked and
hidden in its time-honored might ...
always open to him who owned it....
I left it like a beaten man. But I could
not retire into a corner and mourn, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
had you, Finn. You were only a little child
then, so I could not know how your paths
would go. I knew only one thing, that
you would never sit with your wife up
there, where people became so small when
they sat down in the big chairs and where
it was so pleasant and so safe. I was the
last. With me, the tradition of the old
room was finished.... Then I had to try
if I could find my way in the world which
I did not understand. I had to go through
all that which I disliked so desperately
and which had killed my happiness. For
myself, I had nothing to gain: I was a
bound man and a wounded. But I had
you, Finn.... And I had to know if
they were building properly and honestly
somewhere behind all the dancing and
flirting and singing which I saw before
my eyes. Or if it was no different from
what my eyes saw and if I should not be
doing best to carry my child out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
mountains and let the wild beasts tear it
to pieces.... I was alone in this. Your
mother went to live in an old house beside
the old house where her happiness
could not grow. There she found peace.
But I needed no refuge. Where I was,
I was at home: I only wanted to see the
place where you and your children should
flourish.... I did not spare myself, Finn.
I sought honestly, south and north, east
and west. I took their books ... the
light ones burst like soap-bubbles in my
hands and the powerful ones my thoughts
had to struggle to understand. Not one
of their green visions but has been with
me in my room, not one of their bright
swords but has flashed before my eyes....
I did not allow myself to be blinded
by my own bitterness, or tricked by catch-words,
or frightened by abuse. I went
on as long as I could see the way ... and
longer, Finn. I peered out into the farthest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
where those who thought as I did
saw nothing but horror and insanity....
And Finn ... I don&#8217;t know....
Perhaps it was your mother&#8217;s God that
helped me ... perhaps it was my ancestor,
who himself had sailed into harbor
and raised our house on new ground
for many a good, long day. Perhaps it was
your little hand, which lay so trustingly
in mine, when you used to come to me in
those anxious, lonely days and say good-morning
and good-night.... I don&#8217;t know.
I daresay it was my love for you that
lifted me above myself. I climbed as high
up the mountains as a mortal can climb.
It all lay under my feet like a cloud ...
longing and happiness and daily bread
and daily trouble. I could not see the
valley in which my house was built. But
out of the cloud, over the mountain, I saw
the road where we hustle and strive, generation
after generation, ever forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
towards the goal which we cannot see,
but which is there, because the road is
there.... And I saw land ... the promised
land of you and your children ...
from the mountain where I stood. A
land I did not know ... a land strange
to my eyes ... people with other habits
and other beliefs, with a different form of
love and a different code of honor....
I saw it through the storm that flung the
door of the old room wide open.... That
was a strange time, Finn ... the strongest
in my life and the happiest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt stood at the window with his
arms crossed over his chest. He looked
at his son and smiled sadly. Finn sat
still, with his head thrown back in his
chair and his eyes closed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I equipped you for the journey,
Finn.... I did not show you this way
or that, for I was a bound man and could
not go with you. I gave you books and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
masters, who opened all the gates of the
world to you. I let you look into the
mist where you wanted to ride. I feared
nothing, because I wanted nothing for
myself and because I had seen through
the mist.... You grew up and I saw
that you grew good and clever. Then I
sat down and waited and longed for the
day when I should wave to you from the
balcony of my old house, when you
marched forth to conquer your new land....
I was right to wait for the day....
Ah.... I have seen them, the poor
devils, hungry and wounded, rush blindfold
towards the new, which they did
not know, because it could not possibly
be worse than the old. I have heard
them call for new laws because they
had violated the old ... they were driven
from their huts and sat on the deck of the
emigrant-ship with their bundle and their
uncertain hope for a better fate in the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
world.... But you.... You had done
no wrong and had nothing to revenge.
Free as a king&#8217;s son, you rode over the
bridge with your retinue and rode through
the world and planted your banner
wherever you chose to dwell. Born of
your mother&#8217;s longing for excitement ...
in your father&#8217;s house, whose walls are as
thick as the walls of a castle ... with the
strong air of the old room in your lungs
and without its yoke upon your neck ...
a rich and spotless nobleman, taking his
place of his own free will in the ranks of
the revolution.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent. His steps sounded
heavily through the stillness:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you with me, Finn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn rose. Cordt put his arm over
his shoulder and they paced the room together.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8220;I had so many dreams, Finn. And
I gained such confidence, because my
own happiness was shattered and I had
you. I had become an old man, but my
mind was not blunted. I had suffered
shipwreck, but I was not afraid of the sea.
I believed in life ... in God, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not walk well together and
Cordt removed his arm. Finn sat down
in his chair again and listened. Cordt
went on walking:</p>



<p>&#8220;Then came the days which you
know ... the days of the present....
You grew up into the quiet man you are.
Your eyes looked heavily upon life, you
shrank back timidly when you saw that
there was fire and smoke on earth....
You kept your scutcheon untarnished,
but that is easily done, when one doesn&#8217;t
fight. You were never in places where
one does not wish to be seen ... that is
true. But you never went outside your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
door, Finn ... never. There was no
fire in your blood, no desire in your
thoughts. You were tired, Finn ... merely
tired.... I grew frightened for you....
As the years passed, you had become more
to me than a son. You were not only flesh
of my flesh and bone of my bone ... you
were a link in the human chain that goes
on through the ages, ever onward. Your
hand was in mine, but your life was more
precious than mine. For you had to carry
a greater burden and to carry it into new
ways.... Remember, Finn, I had been
on the mountain and seen through the
mist. It was more than the question of
an inheritance, more than family pride
and family loyalty. You and I were
allied in a great cause. And I sat with
the map before me and followed the course
of the battle ... like an old soldier, who
can no longer sally forth himself, but who
has his son and his colors and his emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
under fire.... Remember how I had
arrived at where I was. Remember what
I had lost, what I had let go, how completely
I had sacrificed myself for you.
I had you, Finn ... had I anything else?...
When I, then, became frightened for
you, I plunged into my wonderful treasure
and endowed you lavishly. I told you
the legend of the old house and thought
it would call you to arms, like the blast
of the bugle over the camp. I revealed
your father&#8217;s and your mother&#8217;s fate to
you, that you might see how people fight
for happiness. I sent you out into the
world, where life is bigger and stronger
than at home, so that life might make you
into a man.... But never ... never did
I put any constraint upon you. Never
did I usurp the place of Providence....
And you turned over the pages of
the picture-book and came home paler
than before and wearier. The old room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
was merely a charming poem to you, that
sang you into deeper dreams. Up there
... where the strong men of our race met
their wives, when the sun went down upon
the business of the day, and talked gladly
and earnestly when their hearts impelled
them to ... there you sit, alone, all day
long, with your slack hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he laid his hands firmly on
Finn&#8217;s shoulders. And Finn looked up
with moist eyes and quivering mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day, Finn, I have given you your
inheritance. From to-day, I look upon
you as of age. You were such that one
could not use coercion with you ... and,
in fact, there was none that wanted to use
it. Nor could one be angry with you
... you were the same ... it was the
same ... always. To-day, that is past.
Go out and buy yourself a house and take
a wife and have children by her. And
remember that, if there were some in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
family that fell, there was none that
flinched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father.... I understand you ... but
I cannot do what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt took a step back and tossed his
thick hair from his forehead:</p>

<p>&#8220;You pale people <i>understand</i> everything,
because no faith blinds your eyes:
you are so kind and clever, you think.
You judge leniently, you do not judge at
all, you know that the truth is nowhere
and everywhere. You justify every silly
thought you have entertained ... you sit
for all time and contemplate your navel
... and then you let the murderer go
and the thief escape. God help you poor
wretches! The stupidest, the most ignorant
dervish is cleverer and kinder than you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn wanted to say something, but
Cordt made a preventive gesture with his
hand:</p>

<p>&#8220;A man <i>must</i> not understand everything.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
He must choose and judge and
reject. If he doesn&#8217;t do that, there is no
happiness in the world and no loyalty and
no peace. And, if he cannot hate, he
cannot love either.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the window and looked out.
And, as he stood there, Finn came up to
him and seized his hand and looked at
him pleadingly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do what you want,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>But Cordt withdrew his hand and
moved away from him:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to say that to me,
Finn. I won&#8217;t listen to it. For what I
want is only that you should live. Take
the inheritance which I have given you
and use it as you can. One day, you
shall be called upon to answer for your
son, as I to-day for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finn smiled sadly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never have a son,&#8221; he said,
softly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>Cordt did not hear what he said. He
was struggling with a memory ... passed
his hand over his face and stared before
him. He saw Fru Adelheid ... that
evening in the old room, when she had
said what Finn was saying now ... the
same hopeless, impotent words: &#8220;I cannot
do what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down and fell back in his chair.</p>

<p>All the despair of the old days came
over him like a tremendous weariness.
He was struggling against what was
stronger than himself. He had nothing
to set against that eternal, hopeless, &#8220;I
cannot do what you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he sprang up and stood in front
of Finn with blazing eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s your mother who paralyzes
your will, then fly from her, hate her,
thrust her from you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father ... father....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hate her, I say. She was smitten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
with the pestilence from her youth. She
understood everything ... like you. To
her nothing was small or great, nothing
near or far. Her will was gone, like
yours. She knew where the glory lay, if
she could reach it, but she could not. She
hearkened to the times and the times
made her their own. She was always
sick ... sick unto death.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the room and said nothing
more.</p>

<p>They were both of them very pale
and both longed to be alone. They
had nothing more to say to each
other.</p>

<p>And Finn was not angry on his mother&#8217;s
account. He thought only of the one
thing, that he could not do what Cordt
wanted and could not appease his sorrow
... could not even tell him that he
loved him. And then he longed to sit
still ... in the old room ... with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
mother, who was so pretty and whom he
had never offended:</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you angry with me, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt looked at him long and intently.
Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, when Finn was gone, he sat with
his face buried in his hands and wept.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Cordt</span> entered, dressed to go out, and
hurriedly crossed the room.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sat writing. She looked
up, as he came in, and went on writing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Finn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upstairs, I suppose ... in his room,&#8221;
she answered, without looking at him.</p>

<p>He stood at the window for a moment.
Then he flung himself into a chair and
got up again and stood by the table at
which she was sitting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been with him to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>She closed her blotting-book and turned
her chair so that her face was in shadow.
Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Finn is too much alone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded and said yes again; then
stood with his head bowed deep in
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so quiet here,&#8221; said Fru Adelheid.
&#8220;You are not happy and Finn
notices it. And Hans is away....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... yes....&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed her arms over her breast
and sat silent and looked at the tip of her
foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid....&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt drew himself erect:</p>

<p>&#8220;We will fill the house with gayety,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We will go and pay visits to-morrow
morning ... you and Finn and
I ... to old friends and new. We will
have young and cheerful people here and
pretty women and clever men ... lights
and music.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up at him. He smiled and
put his hand on her shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Cordt talked about it a little and then
went out hurriedly.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid remained sitting long.
The room grew dark. The lamps before
the gateway were lit and their flickering
gleams danced on the ceiling. The
fire in the hearth smouldered under the
ashes. Where she sat, no light fell; her
white dress shone faintly through the
gloom.</p>

<p>She thought of Cordt&#8217;s smile ... he
had said that to her much as though he
were asking one of the people in the office
to take pains in a difficult matter.</p>

<p>She thought of Finn, who looked at her
with such strange eyes, as though the relations
between him and his mother had
changed and he could not understand it.</p>

<p>She thought of herself. She felt like
a tree in autumn, when the leaves fall
... a tree that had always thought itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
green and beautiful until now, when
it saw its glory flutter before the wind.</p>

<p>And, day after day and every hour of
the day, she rebuilt it all as it might have
been.</p>

<p>She built up the temple of the old room
again and locked the door with seven
seals. She put time back and sat with
her little boy in her lap and resented
old Marie&#8217;s undressing him and singing
him to sleep. She put time forward and
celebrated the day when Finn should
lead his wife into the secret chamber of
the house and tell her all about it, in all
its beauty and solemnity, and write his
name and hers on the yellow document.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid smiled sadly.</p>

<p>She thought she was like the man who
had put the celestial globe up there in
the old room ... the man whose intellect
was obscured and who sat and played
with the stars until he died.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>But her thoughts always went the same
way, while the darkness fell ever closer
about Cordt&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>She wondered, would it be any use
now, if the house were filled with lights
and gayety? Or would the darkness lurk
in every gloomy corner and spring forth
when the feast was over and for ever hide
the three who moved about the house,
each his own way, anxiously and alone?</p>

<p>She did not know. But she always
thought of it. And there was nothing
tempestuous in her hope and in her fear
and in her regret.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid was calm now, always.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> the stately house on the square
was lit up with gayety.</p>

<p>The horses trampled in the gateway
and the servants ran up and down the
carpeted stairs. The great drawing-rooms
streamed with lights and flowers and
music and the floor was filled with
dancers.</p>

<p>It was a wealth and splendor even
greater than in the old days, for now the
master of the house was a more lavish
host than he had ever been before. He
could never have things fine enough,
luxurious enough. He saw to everything,
was everywhere and moved among his
guests so that they could see that he delighted
in them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>The entertainments at Cordt&#8217;s house
became legendary. And all that were
rich and beautiful and noble and intelligent
came when he invited them and
came gratefully and were glad to stay.</p>

<p>The men gathered close about the lady
of the house, who was charming in her
white gown, with her white hair.</p>

<p>Those who had paid her their homage
in the old days raised their grey heads
when she passed them and followed her
tall figure with a gleam of their youthful
fire in their eyes. And those who were
now young wondered when they heard
the old ones tell that she was once a
thousand times prettier.</p>

<p>Or not prettier, perhaps. But such
that every man on whom her eyes fell
was, from that moment, hers and that
every glance she vouchsafed was remembered
for all time.</p>

<p>Now she was more remote in her smiles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Her glance was deeper, but it was as
though it did not see. Her red mouth no
longer promised happiness as it used to.
Any one would think it a happiness to win
her. But no one would believe it possible.</p>

<p>And, while they saw her thus in the
light of their youth, they wondered what
could have happened in the years that
had passed and why the house had so
long been closed and why it had now so
suddenly opened its doors wide to the
world which holds revel daily.</p>

<p>But their thoughts never grew to the
shadow of a slander.</p>

<p>They asked her to sing. And, as she
sat at the piano and looked through the
room with her great, strange eyes, the
old friends of the house remembered the
glowing songs of her youth, which had
set their blood aflame as she exulted and
wept in them with desire and love.</p>

<p>But now, when she sang, the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
ones listened, enraptured with her voice,
which was so bright and so clear and so
wonderfully still:</p>

<p>There was a brief silence when she
ceased. Then they crowded round her
in admiration and with endless requests
for more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>Fru Adelheid rose. She talked and
smiled and thanked them. But her glance
wandered far beyond all these people,
who meant nothing to her, to Cordt, who
stood at the far end of the room and was
talking to some one and did not see her
and had not heard her.</p>

<p>But Finn had heard her. And Finn
had seen her great, humble, plaintive look.</p>

<p>He did not take his eyes off her and
strange thoughts hurried through his
head. He now understood what had
happened in this house. He knew why
Fru Adelheid had come to him so seldom,
lately, in the old room. Why she had
sat so silent, steeped in distant thoughts
... why her glance had been so uncertain
and so timid, her words so wavering, her
hand so slack in his.</p>

<p>And he felt that the last bond was
broken that bound him to mankind.</p>

<p>He had lost his mother, now that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
was pushing hardest towards her. When
she came to him now, it was Cordt she
looked for. Were he to go to her now
and lie down before her with his cheek on
her hand, as he had so often done, she
would lift him up and bid him go out into
the world and live.</p>

<p>He had a feeling as though he had been
betrayed, but, at the same time, he wept
with her in his heart. He looked at his
father and thought how much more of a
man he was than she suspected in her
poor, tardy repentance. He looked at
his mother and felt a curious loving contempt
for her ... such as men feel for a
woman who comes to them and begs for
something a thousand times less important
than what she once possessed and
despised.</p>

<p>Then he had to go into the crowd of
people, who offered him their smiles and
asked for his.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>And so strong was the feeling of loneliness
in him that he mingled readily with
the guests of the house and was more
cheerful than usual and more talkative.</p>

<p>He was as pleased to move about these
bright rooms as elsewhere, because he
was no longer at home anywhere. He
might just as well exchange a few words
with these smartly-dressed ladies and
gentlemen, since he had to talk and since
he could no longer tell any one what was
passing within him and since no one could
tell him what he wanted to hear.</p>

<p>The women crowded round him as
the men did round Fru Adelheid. They
wound a circle of white arms and bright
eyes round the young heir of the house,
who was so pale and so handsome and
such that women longed for that which
he did not show. They met him with
charming, flattering words and smiled
upon him and he did not hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
words and broke through the circle without
a trouble and without a sigh.</p>

<p>The men offered him their friendship
and he shook their hands and talked to
them and went away and forgot their
faces. Cordt found him in every corner,
where he had hidden for a moment without
intending to or thinking about it, and
carried him smilingly and teasingly and
jestingly into the throng. And he smiled
to his father and went with him and remained
always alone.</p>

<p>He saw himself and only himself. He
seized upon every thought that arose in
him and discussed it as if it had been
thought by another. He contemplated
every mood that welled up in his soul as
if he had read it in a book.</p>

<p>He climbed high up the peaks upon
which men cannot live ... the peaks
whence they topple down one day or
where they perish in the bright frost. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
there is no sound up there and no air,
no day and no paths. Only light and
always light.</p>

<p>But, when it happened that Cordt&#8217;s
glance fell upon him, without his knowing
it, the loneliness was suddenly extinguished
in his soul.</p>

<p>Then he knew who he was and where
he was and the pain of life gnawed into
his soul. For he constantly read the eternal,
hopeless, fond question in his father&#8217;s
eyes. He realized what he had forgotten,
that the house was making holiday for
his sake and his sake alone. Every strain
that sounded, every rose that blushed,
every pretty woman who moved across
the floor: they were all his father&#8217;s servants,
who came to him with message
after message that life&#8217;s banquet was
served if he would but take his seat at
the board and drain its golden cup.</p>

<p>Then he thought sadly of his tranquil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
beautiful mother, who had gone from
him, out into life, which did not touch
him. How good it would have been if
they could sit together now and talk and
be silent, while the fountain rippled in
the square and the queer things in the old
room whispered their strange and mighty
legend!</p>

<p>It would have been good for him. And
good for her, he thought. And best of all,
perhaps, for Cordt, who did not see her.</p>

<p>His thoughts gathered in love for
Cordt, who was struggling to the death
in his hopeless fight. He felt as though
his father were a hero in the wars and
wished that he were his meanest page to
buckle on his armor for him and bathe
his wounds and sit beside him with his
lute, when he would sleep.</p>

<p>But the rout ran its course and it was
late before the gate closed behind the
last carriage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>It fell heavily and harshly as though it
were striking angrily at the guests&#8217; heels.
It grated its hinges long and shook its
bolts as though it thought of never opening
again, but of shutting out the world for
ever from that old house, in which no
light could drive away the increasing
gloom, no joyous trumpets drown the
hoarse voices that threatened in the
corners.</p>

<p>Then they sat together for a while
longer, they three who dwelt in the house,
and talked with empty words and empty
eyes.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid it was who first ceased,
because her thoughts were the strongest.
And Finn it was who said the most ...
as though to expiate the fault that oppressed
him.</p>

<p>But it was Cordt who was bitterest in
his care, while indifferent words passed
between those who stood as close together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
as it was possible for mortals to stand and
who feared the silence and who had nothing
more to say to each other.</p>

<p>Then Cordt said good-night and Finn.
But Fru Adelheid told the servants to
leave her for a little and the candles burnt
where the rout had been.</p>

<p>Restlessly she wandered about the room
and again thought of the days that were
gone and could never return. And she
readily surrendered herself to her fancies,
for there was in her now but one hope
and one faith and one repentance.</p>

<p>She fancied that one of the long evenings
was over in which gay acquaintances
filled her rich house and Cordt and she
exchanged glances which only they understood.</p>

<p>She had been to the nursery and leant
over her little boy, who was sleeping with
red cheeks. Now she would take the
reddest flower there was and then go up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the secret stair ... up to where the old
room stood, in its wonderful glory.</p>

<p>There he sat and waited for her.</p>

<p>She saw him as she entered ... he
raised his face to her and nodded and
then lapsed again into his heavy thoughts.
And she stood silent at the window, where
the red flowers blushed before her feet
and the square lay below her in the darkness
of the night and the fountain sang
its refrain, which never begins and never
stops.</p>

<p>Then she rose and crossed the room.
She heard his voice when he talked to her,
as he so often talked ... ever the same
judgment upon the dance that passed over
the world, the same mighty song in praise
of great marriage, the same passionate,
loving prayer that she would only see it
while there was yet time and let those
dance who had nothing better to do and
take the proud place which he offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
her by his side ... in the old chair, in
which people became so small and so
strong, because they sat with their feet
on an altar that was raised in faith and
built up of faith and fenced in with faith
throughout the changing times.</p>

<p>Then, when he had said that and sat
by the chimney, where the fire glowed
and the candles shed their rays sparingly
in the corners of the old room ... she
would stand for a little at the window,
while all was silent in the room, and look
at him, who was the man in her life and
had never ceased to be so. And then
she would go up to him ... slowly and
quietly, because she honored the ground
she trod on ... kneel down where he
sat and raise to him the eyes whose
beauty he had loved, whose glance he
had sought in such great hope and such
great fear.</p>

<p>Then she would tell him exactly how it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
was ... how strong it was and how
silent:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt ... you strong, you irresistible
man ... I love you as you would be
loved. I thank you, because you talked
to me and never grew weary. Because
you always besought me. Because you
waited for me and trusted that the day
would come when the silence of the old
room should turn to gladsome song in my
soul and all the other sounds in the world
like a distant buzz in the woods. Now
I am here ... Cordt ... you strong, you
irresistible man. Now I am yours, as I
was before, and I am yours in the old
room. There is nothing threatening or
gloomy now in the strange things up here
from the vanished days. I can sing to
the old spinet so that no strings snap and
no memories are mortally startled, for I
sing only of you and of my boy and of
my happiness. I can cherish the thread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
upon great-grandmother&#8217;s spinning-wheel
because I have woven the cloth of happiness
in my own room. I can lovingly hide
the wax doll in the folds of the curtain,
because I have lived to see the day when
I went gladly and readily to the secret
chamber of the house and sat there long
and was contented.... But the jar with
the naked man writhing through thorns:
I set that up here when I was not yet what
I am. It shall stand here in memory of
the evil time that pulled at Fru Adelheid&#8217;s
soul and lured her desires with sounds from
the square outside.... And our little boy,
who sleeps with red cheeks, shall grow to
man&#8217;s estate and come up here one day,
when you and I are dead, and sit with
his wife in the chairs in which we sat.
Then he shall know that his mother was
tempted, it is true, but not destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid sat in her corner and
dreamt in the silent, empty rooms.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>Her white gown spread over the floor
about her feet. Her eyes shone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But high up, on the balcony of the old
room, stood Finn and stared into the
night that stretched round about him like
a waveless sea.</p>

<p>It was silent. He did not think, did
not dream. His soul mingled with the
darkness, which was not evil and not
good ... only silent.</p>

<p>He was like a dead man who had been
put on guard on the brink of the tower
and who still stood there, staring with
glazed eyes. The fountain rippled ...
it was as though the water rose over the
edge of the basin and would rise and rise
until it reached the dead man up there
and washed him away.</p>

<p>Then a man came across the square.</p>

<p>He walked and sang, until he set eyes
upon the man who stood up there, high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and dark and motionless. Then he stopped
and looked at him and shouted something.</p>

<p>And the man on the balcony answered
with a shout. And the man below was
seized with fear and ran away and vanished
in the darkness.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
<h3 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV</h3></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Cordt</span> looked into the room where
Fru Adelheid sat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Finn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s in the old room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt closed the door and walked
quickly down the passage. She was
sitting by the window and saw him in the
square below, where he stood and looked
up at the house. Then he walked away,
in such a manner that she could see that
he had no object for his walk.</p>

<p>The servant came and lit the candles.
Fru Adelheid sat down by the fireplace
with her hands in her lap and listened for
a sound in the quiet house.</p>

<p>Soon after, Cordt came home.</p>

<p>She heard his voice in the passage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Then he went into his own room ... now
he was outside again. She understood
that he was on his way to Finn; but the
next moment he came in to where she
was sitting and sat down at a distance
from her:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been up to him to-day,
Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt moved restlessly in his chair, rose
to go and sat down again. Fru Adelheid
struggled with herself not to go over to
him and take his hand and talk to him.
Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been so odd, lately. Brighter
than usual, but more absent, nevertheless.
He is not shamming, but still he is
not himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt went on talking about it, without
looking at her and not so much in
order to tell it to her as because he could
not keep silent. She saw this exactly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
turned away her face and cried quietly.
Then he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you noticed it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he is much as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt rose and crossed the room. He
stood for a time by the chimney, where she
sat, and stared into the fire. She looked
up at him with bright, moist eyes. Then
he went over and sat where he had
been sitting before and it was silent in
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder, oughtn&#8217;t you to go up to
him, Adelheid?&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not hear her reply and looked
across at her. She had stood up and was
coming towards him. He saw that she
was very pale and that she was crying,
but did not think about it and forgot it
again at once.</p>

<p>Then she sat by him ... so close that
her white gown lay over his feet. She
crossed her hands in her lap and parted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
them again and did not look at him while
she spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt....&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>And, when she had said that, she began
to tremble and pressed her hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> ought to go up to him, Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. Then he
bent closer to her and lowered his voice,
as though there were some one in the
room who could hear what he was saying
and must not:</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not. I have frightened him.
He starts when he sees me ... he stands
outside my door and collects his courage
when he comes to me to say good-morning.
I will go quite away from him for a
little while ... go for a journey, I think,
until he becomes more tranquil.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him and pictured him
roaming round the world so that Finn
might recover his tranquillity. She saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
him strolling in distant towns, where life
flowed on around him, alone, knowing
no peace, ever thinking of his son ...
longing for the day when he could come
home, dreading how he would find him
then.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid slipped from her chair
and lay on the floor before him, with her
cheek against his hand and her eyes
streaming with tears.</p>

<p>Cordt did not see. He stared into the
room across her head, with the strained,
racked look which he now always wore
when he was alone:</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not like our parties, Adelheid,&#8221;
he said, meditatively. &#8220;We only
did him harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, if you would go up to him,
Adelheid ... very quietly ... and sit with
him a little, so that he could not give way
to his thoughts. Or help him, so that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
thoughts could find utterance. You two
always got on well together, you know,
and he was glad to see you whenever you
came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is no longer glad to see me,
Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in surprise and encountered
her moist glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I went up now, Cordt ... I could
not sit with Finn as I used to. For I am
no longer the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well!&#8221; was all he said.</p>

<p>He spoke calmly and indifferently, as
though he had had no particular faith
in his remedy and must look round for
something else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt!...&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a scream.</p>

<p>He started. And, as if he had now
first seen that she was kneeling before
him, he pushed back his chair and rose to
his feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>He crossed the room and then came
back and stood and looked at her with a
sense of dislike that increased every
minute. She crept to the chair from
which he had risen and laid her head on
it. She closed her eyes before his glance
and wept silently and without stopping.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You...?</i>&#8221; he said slowly.</p>

<p>She received the blow which the word
gave her without breathing a sound.
Once she opened her eyes and immediately
closed them again. Pale and still
she lay before his feet.</p>

<p>Then his eyes blazed with anger and
scorn:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a number of years have passed
since we two first met, Fru Adelheid ...
what a number of miserable years!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said and raised her head
for a moment and laid it on the chair
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You went away ... in search of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
red happiness. You were not content
with your husband, whom you loved and
who loved you ... you must have all
men on their knees before your beauty
... you must needs see the desire in their
eyes and their unchaste hands cramped
because they dared not lay them upon
Cordt&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, did you find the lover who
bound your will to his foot? And did
he spurn you when he had seen to the
depths of your charming eyes? Or did
you leave him of your own accord ...
and go farther out into the world ... in
search of that which was greater still
and redder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no lover,&#8221; she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>He tossed back the hair from his forehead
and clenched his fists:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You did not. That
is your disgrace and your judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>&#8220;Cordt ... Cordt ... suppose I had
had....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes ... if you had had a lover and
were here to-day, then I should take your
hand and lead you to our son and say to
him, &#8216;Here is your mother, who has been
unhappy. She loved your father and her
love died when the man came who was
more to her than he. She has not known
a really happy day in all these years, because
her fate was too strong for her.
Now she has come to ask for your affection
and needs it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed the room and then came
and stood by her again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up, Adelheid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from the floor and sat down in
her chair again, with her white hands
crossed in her lap, silently and quietly.
He looked at her and it was as though her
humble obedience added to his anger:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you go on the day when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
broke the bonds of your marriage, because
the air in the old room was too pure
for you and too strong? Where have
you been since?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cordt laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me your God.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent over and looked her in the
face:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in your God,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>She did not take her eyes from his
and stretched out her trembling hands to
him and her red mouth quivered with
weeping:</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I don&#8217;t believe in Him either,
Cordt.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away from her. Quietly
she bowed her head, her tears fell upon
her hands, she listened and moaned under
the blows which she had received and
longed for more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>But Cordt sat at the window and looked
out where the rain came pouring down
and the flame of the lamps flickered in the
wind. His anger was over. He could
not remember what they had been talking
of. His thoughts were where they
always were and all the rest was nothing.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly stood by her again
and struck his hand on his temples and
looked at her with fear in his eyes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid ... do you think Finn won&#8217;t
come to us at all to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>She understood that it was too late ...
irremediably, hopelessly too late. She
would never be able to tell him what was
burning in her soul. He would never
know that she did not come, because she
was weary and because she was afraid,
but that she had honestly wiped out the
bad years of her life and stood again as
he would have had her the time ... the
time he wanted to have her thus.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>&#8220;He will come and say good-night,&#8221;
she said calmly.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid raised her folded hands
to her mouth.</p>

<p>Things could not remain thus for ever.
But she could wait. She could go barefoot
over the stones, if only once she
reached a place in his house where she
could stay. There must be a road somewhere
that led to him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And the evening sped on.</p>

<p>She sat beside him again and held his
hand in hers, happy that he allowed her
to keep it. She wanted to push his hair
off his forehead, where the wrinkles lay so
sharply marked, but did not. She wanted
to put her hands on his tired eyes, but
dared not.</p>

<p>They talked of Finn and she talked
softly and soothingly to him as to a child,
happy to be going the way he wanted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
She found such gentle words and such
impressive ones ... she found her smile
again and looked at him and met his
smile, which came stealing to his face like
a sun-gleam and vanished again at once.</p>

<p>He heard but little of what she said.
But the sound of her voice did him good.
He heard it and the rain, which beat
against the panes, and it grew warm and
peaceful around him.</p>

<p>His fears, which had aroused and spied
and driven his every thought and turned
and weighed his every doubt, slumbered
in this quiet hour. He sat there like an
old man who has suffered so much that
his faculties have been blunted to pain
and who takes his solace as it comes and
is thankful.</p>

<p>He looked at her as he used to look at
his mother when he was young and unhappy.
He thought of her as of a young
girl who knew the old man so little and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
owed him nothing, but went to his chair
and laid her roses in his hand, so that
things might be a little pleasanter for
him.</p>

<p>And once he moved uneasily in his
chair and looked at her quite differently
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Adelheid ... why have I no child
but him?&#8221;</p>

<p>He said that very quietly and, a little
after, he said it again. He said it to
himself and not to her. She saw this and
wept, because she knew he did not perceive
it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And the evening sped on.</p>

<p>They sat quietly and she was silent and
talked again of their son up there in the
old room. Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Cordt, let us go up to him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened anxiously whether he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
say any more ... whether he would reflect
who she was and thrust her from
him in anger, as he had done before.</p>

<p>But he sat silent and looked at the red
glow in the fireplace.</p>

<p>Then she rose and put out her hands
to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come ... Cordt ... let us go. We
will sit with him a little and talk to him,
quietly and cheerfully, till the shadows
disappear. Then we will come down
here again and they will return, when he
is alone. But we will go up every day
and fight with them for him and win
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose heavily and took her hand.</p>

<p>Fru Adelheid led him through the room
like a child. They went through the long
passage and up the secret stairs.... She
was always a little in front of him. Her
eyes shone with happiness. The bells
rang out in her soul and she held Cordt&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
hand so fast as though she would never
let it go.</p>

<p>They came to the door of the old room
and knocked and listened. She looked at
him and bent over his hand and kissed
it with streaming tears.</p>

<p>Then she opened the door briskly and
went in with head uplifted and drew him
after her.</p>

<p>Over by the window sat Cordt&#8217;s son,
in one of the big chairs. He had shot
himself.</p>
